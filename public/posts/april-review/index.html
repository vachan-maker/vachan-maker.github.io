                <p>What I did in the month of April</p>
            
            <p class="postMeta"><strong>Posted On:</strong> Sat May 11, 2024 </p>
            <hr />
            <p>Last month, I did not publish a month in review because I was just feeling lazy (lol). So I have packed things I did in the last two months in this post.</p>
<h2 id="college">College</h2>
<p>Classes are going alright. I don&rsquo;t really enjoy this semester. It is so hot and sitting in class in this heat is just unbearable. There is no other option but just to adjust to it.</p>
<p>I also had my internal exams and scored decent marks. But I am find it tough to study the paper - Computer Organization &amp; Architecture.</p>
<h2 id="updates-to-the-site">Updates to the site</h2>
<p>As you can see, I have switched to a new domain <a href="https://vachan-maker.github.io">vachan.me</a> which I am super thrilled about. But I don&rsquo;t really know what I will do when it expires next year. It was included for free in the Github Student Pack.</p>
<p>You also probably noticed the ðŸ¥³ emoji in the nav bar. When you click on it, party mode is activated. Wohooo! You can click on it as much as you want. I am planning on adding even more easter eggs.</p>
<h2 id="movies">Movies</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>GoatLife (Aadujeevitham)</strong>: I watched GoatLife, a malayalam survival film, directed by Blessy. GoatLife is based on the novel of the same name by Benyamin. The movie was okay. I just felt like there was something missing. It didn&rsquo;t really have that punch or emotional impact. Yes, Blessy and the entire crew worked really hard at making the film but it could have been better. It is a decent one time watch movie.</li>
<li><strong>Premalu</strong>: Premalu is a romantic comedy film starring Naslen and Mamitha Baiju. I think I watched the movie the day after watching GoatLife. This one was fun and a delight to watch. It&rsquo;s the usual guy has a cursh on a girl plot but with good humour. Premalu is a great choice to watch with friends and family.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="music">Music</h2>
<p>Last month, I listened to a lot of songs by Coldplay, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Oliva Rodrigo and Ariana Grande.</p>
<p>I re-discovered the song Welcome to My Island and Bunny Is a Rider by Caroline Polachek.</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>Results of the third semester was published recently and I passed all subjects. Yayy! Now in a few more days, I will be writing fourth semester exams.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-thoughts">Finishing Thoughts</h2>
<p>I think that is all the pretty much things I can remember.</p>
<p>I am behind the 100 Days to Offload Challenge. I need to push more posts to my blog to finish the challenge within a year.</p>
<p>So that is all. Have a great day people!</p>
<p>This is day 24 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaystoOffload</a></p>
