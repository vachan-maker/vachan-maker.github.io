Huh it&rsquo;s already March. That was fast! And the heat is just unbearable.</p>
<p>I had my third semester lab exams (OOP in Java &amp; Data Structures) at the beginning of this month and I was really anxious about it because this was actually my first lab exam. There were a lot of programs to study and I thought I would blank out at the middle of writing a program and or not even know how to do a program the examiner asked. But thankfully, I was able to perform pretty well in the exam and got the output for both the labs.</p>
<p>Valentine&rsquo;s day coincided with my data structure exam and on the day before it, I discovered a site called the love calculator created by <a href="https://aldrinjenson.com/">Aldrin Jenson</a>. It asked the person who their crush is and after submitting the form it rickrolls the person. I really loved this harmless prank and decided to create a clone of it. It was really fun to make and I got good responses from my friends. You can read more about it <a href="/posts/pranking-my-friends-on-valentines-day/">here</a>.</p>
<p>Since answer sheet evaluation was taking place, our college gave us a short break.</p>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maramon_Convention">Maramon Convention</a>, a week long Chrisitian convention held every year began that week and I went there and atteneded a few sessions. I also met a good number of people there.</p>
<p>I spent the rest of the days working on redesigning this website. Initially, I created this website using a theme called <a href="https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nightfall">Nightfall</a>. It is an alright theme but there were a some things about it which I didn&rsquo;t like. I was able to fix most of the issues but in the end I decided to go with a new custom design. If you want to know more, check the post I wrote about the process. On top of that, this site has new pages like a <a href="/now">Now</a> page,
and a <a href="/links">Links</a> page.</p>
<p>I also accidentally binge watched <a href="https://anilist.co/anime/20958/Attack-on-Titan-Season-2/">Attack on Titan season 2</a> and completed the season in a day. The show caught my attention and I just couldn&rsquo;t stop watching it.</p>
<p>After the short vacation, classes began again. Compared to the previous semester, this sem is actually pretty boring. I am also finding a paper called Computer Organisation Architecture somewhat difficult.</p>
<p>This is day 11 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaystoOffload</a></p>
