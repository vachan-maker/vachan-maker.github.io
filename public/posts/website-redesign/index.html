            <hr />
            <p>I am currenly enjoying a short break from college and I used the time for revamping my website. I did change the appearence of this site a few weeks ago but that was nothing major. I wanted my website to have a little bit more of a personal touch.</p>
<p>The whole process actually took a lot more time than I expected and it is still not complete.</p>
<p>The site now has a new color scheme - a really nice teal color palette. I actually came across the palette while going through Tailwind CSS documentation.</p>
<p>The whole website is a culmination of things I love from blogs of other people.</p>
<p><a href="https://simplecss.orgs">Simple.css</a> is used as the base for typograhy and spacing.</p>
<p>You might think &lsquo;why does the navigation menu looks so familiar?&rsquo;. Well, it is copied from <a href="https://joelchrono.xyz">Joel Chrono&rsquo;s</a> blog.</p>
<p>I also referred to the sites of <a href="https://kevq.uk">Kev Quirk</a>, <a href="https://rknight.me/">Robb Knight</a>, <a href="https://arun.blog">Arun</a> and  <a href="https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/">Simone Silvestroni</a>.</p>
<p>The text (à´µà´šàµ») above the navigation bar is actually my name written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam">Malayalam</a>, my mother tongue. The font used is <a href="https://rachana.org.in/glist-kutty-bold.html">RIT Kutty Bold</a>.</p>
<p>I also added some new pages.</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/now">now</a> page tells you what I am  doing now.</li>
<li><a href="/uses">Uses</a> page tells you what hardware and software I use.</li>
<li>A <a href="/faves">faves</a> page for sharing the music, tv-shows and movies I like. It is not complete.</li>
<li>A <a href="/">home</a> page with two photos and some of my recent posts. Earlier my homepage just displayed my name and the link of my social media handles. I have moved that to the contact page, which is also new.</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthere more, I added <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">goatcounter</a> analytics to get an idea on how many people visit my site. There is also now a reply via email button at the bottom of every post.</p>
<p>The whole process taught me a lot. Even though I reused most of the hugo code from the previous theme, I got a good grip on how Hugo works - about partials, pipes, directory structure, etc. I also gained insight on working with branches in git and using Sass for styling.</p>
<p>I really love how everything looks in the end. If you have any feedback, please feel free to get in touch with me.</p>
