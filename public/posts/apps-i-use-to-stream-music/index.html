            <p>I listen to music all the time and here are the apps that I use to listen to and discover music.</p>
<h3 id="rimusic">RiMusic</h3>
<p>Rimusic is a a great privacy-friendly app to stream music. It streams songs from YouTube Music without ads and is a fork of the awesome <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic/">ViMusic</a> app. It has a ton of features and is extremely customisable. You can download songs and the app even automatically caches songs. Rimusic also supports displaying lyrics for songs.</p>
<p>The app also has a &lsquo;For You&rsquo; section that recommends songs according to your listening history. It works okay but isn&rsquo;t as good as spotify or youtube music.</p>
<p>Overall, RiMusic is a solid app that does its job of streaming music really well and nothing else.</p>
<p>You can download RiMusic from <a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/it.fast4x.rimusic/">F-Droid</a></p>
<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>
<p>I guess on hearing &lsquo;Spotify&rsquo;, you are all ready to come at me with pitchforks.</p>
<p>The main reason why I use Spotify is because I love their recommendation system. I have discovered a lot of great songs on Spotify. There are a lot of good playlists to match your mood and taste. As mentioned earlier, RiMusic isn&rsquo;t good at personalised recommendations. But I haven&rsquo;t abandoned RiMusic yet.</p>
<p>I use the free plan and&hellip;.boy&hellip;the free plan just sucks. You can&rsquo;t even play a playlist/album in order or even srub through songs. Even the shuffle button is paywalled. I wonder, will spotify even offer a free plan in the future.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t let go of RiMusic yet. I still need it to listen to songs offline, play an album in the exact order and etc.</p>
<h3 id="soundcloud">Soundcloud</h3>
<p>I see SoundCloud as a different type of streaming service. One of the cool things about SoundCloud is that anyone can upload songs to the platform. It is a great place to find mashups, bootlegs and remixes.</p>
<p>I personally use it to listen to music while am studying. It has a large library of library of lofi and instrumental tracks.</p>
<p>Soundcloud is also great for discovering EDM, techno and bass boosted songs.</p>
<p>Yeah so these are the services I use. How do you listen to music? I&rsquo;d love to know. Have a great day!</p>
