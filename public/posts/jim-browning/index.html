            <p>Podcast Episode: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObYkyZtHdgI">When Scammers Call, He Strikes Back In the Best WayðŸŽ™Darknet Diaries Ep. 143: Jim Hates Scams</a></p>
<p>So usually I listen to music before going to sleep. Yesterday, I didn&rsquo;t really feel like listening to songs so I went ahead and decided to listen to a podcast called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_Diaries">Darknet Diaries</a>. I hadn&rsquo;t heard about the podcast until yesterday and it mainly focuses on real incidents in the cyberspace.</p>
<p>I listened to the most recent <a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/143/">episode</a> of the podcast (March 5, 2024) which featured <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Browning_(YouTuber)">Jim Browning</a>. You probably have heard of him. He is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNG0osIBAprVcZZ3ic84vw">YouTuber</a> and a software engineer and his work involves investigating online scams and exposing scammers and their operations.</p>
<p>Scammers use social engineering, scripts and software tools to trick the person on the other end of the phone. Usually a scammer will try to trick someone into thinking there is something wrong with their computer and steal money from them. (There are many other type of scams as well like refund scams)</p>
<p>The work that Jim does and the videos that he publishes on YouTube raise awareness of different scam operations and are entertaining to watch as well. He also has helped several people from not being victim to scams.</p>
<p>One of the incidents Jim shared on the podcast was actually pretty funny. He hacked into one of the scammer&rsquo;s computer and got a list of all the real names and the fake names of all the people working in the scam call center. He then called the scammer by their real name. All the scammers in the room were taken by surprise and their reactions were amusing.</p>
<p>Another time, he actually was able to access the CCTV camera feeds of a scam centre and see everything going inside.</p>
<p>I could keep going on and on. The episode is an hour long and is definetly worth the listen. This is the first episode of Darknet Diaries that I listened to and I really liked it!</p>
<p>Just wanted to share this with you.</p>
<p>This is day 13 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaystoOffload</a></p>
