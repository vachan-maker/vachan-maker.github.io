      <description>&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I know its been a long time since I wrote any posts here. I just want to give everyone an update.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t written posts for so long because I have become a little bit more busy with college. I am also spending some of my of time coding little projects and learning new stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I think the actual reason is my laziness. I do like writing these posts but most of the time I am just lazy to do it. Writing a post requires time and sometimes research.  I have to read my posts several times and look for any typos or mistakes. Sometimes, I come across big blunders after publishing a post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned earlier how I have become a bit more busy. But I am not so busy that I can&amp;rsquo;t find time to write a post. I am just lazy to spend some effort in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, I have lost my initial enthusiasm when I started this blog. I also kind of have lost interest in the #100DaystoOffload challenge. But does this mean, I have given up? Not yet. I am going to keep trying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I am currently in the fifth semester (3rd year) in college and I am getting closer to finishing my course. (3 more semesters to go!)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So how is this semester? To be completely honest, it is boring. IMO, this sem is the least interesting semester yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have to learn subjects such as Microprocessor, System Software, Finite Language and Automata Theory, Computer Networking, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But just because these subjects are boring doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I can&amp;rsquo;t just shut my brain and not learn them. I have to study these subjects and pass the exams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the good thing is that this semester will be over by the beginning of November.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I wrote this mainly to just get myself more active in writing blog posts. More posts are coming!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Why I chose Debian as my first Linux distro</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/why-i-chose-debian-as-my-first-distro/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Due to Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s strict hardware requirements for Windows 11, I decided to ditch Windows entirely and switch to Linux in 2023. A few years back,I had attempted to try out Ubuntu but that failed miserably and I actually ended up destroying my USB drive in the process (I failed at step 1 and I still don&amp;rsquo;t know how I broke my flashdrive&amp;hellip;.lol).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, one of most the challenging aspect of switching to GNU/Linux is choosing a distribution. There are a ton of options out there and it can feel overwhelming. Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop OS! and Fedora are some of the most recommended distributions for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in title of this post, after doing my research, I finally went with Debian stable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Okay here is the thing - I am a guy who actually loves using the latest software on my device. I love trying out new features and being up to date. So you might be scratching your head and probably thinking &amp;ldquo;Why on earth did this guy install Debian stable?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are the reasons why I selected Debian:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High Stability - Debian is loved by many Linux users for its stability and reliability. Debian is considered as a good and trustworthy friend who will never let you down. I wanted to experience why people loved debian so much and the rock solid nature of debian first hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just wanted a distro that works and didn&amp;rsquo;t want to spend time fixing things.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Release of Debian Bookworm - I installed Debian on my laptop, a month after the release of Debian bookworm. At that time, the release of Debain 12 was making buzz everywhere and many Linux youtubers were doing reviews and posting videos about it. People were really excited about it and all this excitement made me want to try debian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No Snaps - I still think Ubuntu would have actually been a good option for me but the only reason I decided not to go with Ubuntu is because of how the distribution constantly forced people to use snaps.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Debian for a year now and I am really happy with it. Yes, I still kind of miss having the latest updates and software on my system but thanks to flatpaks I can still have access to the newest versions of software without having to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://backports.debian.org/&#34;&gt;backports&lt;/a&gt; (which I haven&amp;rsquo;t tried yet).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 35 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Visualizing my Website Analytics with Python</title>

      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/visualizing-my-website-analytics-in-python/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently completed a mini course on data science and machine learning using Python. I learnt how to manipulate, clean, and analyze data using Python libraries such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandas.pydata.org/&#34;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://matplotlib.org/&#34;&gt;Matplotlib&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://numpy.org/&#34;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; and various machine learning algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A while back, I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/posts/goat-counter/&#34;&gt;GoatCounter&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open source web analytics service that I use to track traffic on my website. GoatCounter lets you export the data as .csv file and I decided to explore the data.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had to clean the dataset and remove null values and disregard visits by bots. The csv format used by GoatCounter is explained &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goatcounter.com/help/export#csv-format-72&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are the results:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;posts2.png&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Top 10 posts with the most visits.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Top 10 posts with the most visits.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;os.png&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Operating System Popularity&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Operating System Popularity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;In the above pie chart, Android is the clear winner because the majority of people who visit my website are from India. Windows is the runner up.&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;browser.png&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Browser Popularity&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Browser Popularity&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;browservsos.png&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Popularity of browsers used on various operating systems.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Popularity of browsers used on various operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GoatCounter does already give good visualizations of the data but I decided to do it on my own just for applying what I have learned from the course. The graphs above are really basic but the whole process of using pandas and matplotlib to generate these visualisations was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 34 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>It&#39;s time to stop using Authy</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/its-time-to-stop-using-authy/</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2024 14:27:30 +0530</pubDate><author>vachan@tutanota.com (Vachan S Panicker)</author>
      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/its-time-to-stop-using-authy/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Authy is a very popular app for storing and managing 2FA(Two Factor Authentication) tokens. When I first started activating 2FA on my accounts, I used Authy to store all my TOTP tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the key reasons why I went with Authy is because of its cloud sync feature and their desktop app(which is now discontinued). The cloud sync feature allowed me to access all my 2FA tokens on multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But a few months later, I decided to switch to Aegis, a free and open source offline authenticator app. Switching from Authy was a pain because the app doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a feature to export all the tokens. This was super annoying and I hated how they created a walled garden. So I had to go to each of my accounts and then re-enable 2FA and scan the QR code using Aegis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If Twilio (company behind Authy) all of a sudden decides to shut down their Authy service, will you be given the option to export your tokens? I don&amp;rsquo;t think so. It is always better to use an app that gives you full control and freedom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not only that but a few days ago, Authy announced that they were hacked and according to a report by &lt;a href=&#34;https://techcrunch.com/2024/07/03/twilio-says-hackers-identified-cell-phone-numbers-of-two-factor-app-authy-users/&#34;&gt;Techcrunch&lt;/a&gt;, 33 million phone numbers were stolen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a company that focuses on security and providing 2FA related services, this is bad news.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what are some alternatives to Authy?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-aegishttpsgetaegisapp&#34;&gt;1. &lt;a href=&#34;https://getaegis.app/&#34;&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Aegis is an awesome offline authenticator application. It has a nice, clean and easy to use interface and is completely free and open source. Compared to Authy, the app is overkill and offers a ton of features. It even allows you to backup your data and export all your tokens periodically. You can customize it by changing views and using custom icon packs. Also, you can organize and group the tokens as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have used Aegis for years and it is an excellent choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-bitwarden-authenticatorhttpsbitwardencomproductsauthenticator&#34;&gt;2. &lt;a href=&#34;https://bitwarden.com/products/authenticator/&#34;&gt;Bitwarden Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bitwarden is a popular name among password management services. I have been using Bitwarden for more than  four years to manage all my passwords.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But did you know that Bitwarden recently launched a dedicated Authenticator app?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The bitwarden authenticator app is a standalone app from the Bitwarden password manager app&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I am using Bitwarden Authenticator for a change and it is good. Since the app is fairly new, it is kind of barebones and doesn&amp;rsquo;t offer as many features as Aegis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of writing this post, the app does not have a cloud synchronization feature (but it is on the roadmap). All the tokens are stored on your device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to access your tokens on multiple devices, the bitwarden password manager app does allow you to store 2FA tokens along with all your logins.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-ente-authhttpsenteioauth&#34;&gt;3. &lt;a href=&#34;https://ente.io/auth/&#34;&gt;Ente Auth&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ente is well-known for its  Ente Photos solution, which is a privacy focused open source alternative to Google Photos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually tried Ente Auth after seeing it on Hacker News and my initial impressions is that I really love the app. The app has a beautiful interface and is easy to use. I can  access my 2FA tokens on multiple devices through a browser.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ente can be considered as the best alternative to authy because of its cross-platform sync feature.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to store the tokens offline, the app allows that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One cool feature of this app that really stood out is that it displays the next token before the current token expires.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem with Authy is not that it is just proprietary but the service also locks you in and makes it difficult for you to shift to another app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using the above alternatives puts you in control. There are many more alternatives like Keepass XC that I haven&amp;rsquo;t mentioned. Choose one that suits you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 33 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Should schools and colleges stop using WhatsApp?</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/should-schools-and-colleges-stop-using-whatsapp/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jul 2024 09:40:00 +0530</pubDate><author>vachan@tutanota.com (Vachan S Panicker)</author>
      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/should-schools-and-colleges-stop-using-whatsapp/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In India, WhatsApp is the most popular messaging app. Everyone uses it and the app has become so integrated into our lives.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to plan a trip, what is the first thing you do? Create a WhatsApp group, ofcourse. If you want to pay your bills or send money, you can use WhatsApp. If you want to buy something from a store, you can use the app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Signed up for a workshop or an event? You are likely to be added to a WhatsApp group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The messaging app is also popular among the educational institutions here. That is what I really want to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The college that I study in primarily uses WhatsApp for communications. Teachers use the app to send notes and share updates and important announcements. In addition to the main class group, we also have specific groups corresponding to each subjects that we have to study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are also groups for special events, worshops and clubs as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have studied in several schools and they all use the app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But in my opinion, WhatsApp is not the best option for educational institutions. Schools and colleges using WhatsApp should consider shifting to another platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-why-is-whatsapp-widely-used-by-educational-institutions&#34;&gt;So why is WhatsApp widely used by educational institutions?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple and I mentioned it before. WhatsApp is incredibly popular and literally everyone uses it here. Teachers don&amp;rsquo;t need to force students to install another app. All they need is our number and within a few moments, we are all added to a group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WhatsApp is simple, familiar, and convenient.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-the-problem-with-using-whatsapp&#34;&gt;What is the problem with using WhatsApp?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, WhatsApp is owned by Facebook (Meta) and we all know that Facebook and privacy don&amp;rsquo;t  go well together. Meta claims that the app uses end-to-end encryption and they don&amp;rsquo;t read your conversations. But can we really trust Meta? NO!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, WhatsApp deletes the files from their servers after a certain period of time. If you don&amp;rsquo;t download a file within that specific time frame, the file will be deleted from the server and you will have to ask the sender to send you the file again. This is really annoying and has happened to me so many times.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The next problem with the app is that it is usually hard to find something. Yes, the app does have a search feature but it isn&amp;rsquo;t all that great. Not only that, it is also possible for you to completely miss an important message. Sometimes, group chats  get really busy with a lot of messages and there probably may be some update or announcement buried in there. There have been occassions where I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find a message or attachment and had to ask my friends to find it and send it to me (..lol).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the app is mainly a messaging app, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have any organizational features. You can&amp;rsquo;t group documents together and create a folder. There isn&amp;rsquo;t a way to group notes according to a module or a subject. The group management features of WhatsApp are also not that great either.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All these problems are caused by using an app that is not designed and not suited to be used in educational institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-is-a-better-choice-than-whatsapp&#34;&gt;So what is a better choice than WhatsApp?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To be completely honest, I really don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using an LMS like Moodle or Blackboard is usually the option people bring up. My college did host moodle during the pandemic (before I joined college) but they don&amp;rsquo;t use it anymore. I did try out the official moodle demo instance for some time and it seems to be a great choice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you know any other alternatives, I would love to hear it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;wrapping-it-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping it up&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though I haven&amp;rsquo;t used an LMS like Moodle extensively, I am pretty sure teachers and students will find using Moodle much more easier and convenient than using a messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>My iPod nano</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/my-ipod-nano/</link>

      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/my-ipod-nano/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A while back I wrote a post on the apps that I use to stream music. However, before I had my own smartphone and before streaming services became popular, I used an iPod nano to listen to music. If you don&amp;rsquo;t remember it, an iPod nano is similar to an iPod shuffle but with an LCD screen. (I don&amp;rsquo;t have my iPod with me anymore but &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/docs/ipod/133018&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is a photo of it I found.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I graciously received my friend&amp;rsquo;s iPod Nano after asking if I could have it, as he was already using his phone for listening to music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I loved my iPod and I used it all the time to listen to songs. If I remember correctly, my iPod had 8GB of storage and that was plenty of space to store more than a thousand songs. Since it was so small, I could carry it in my pocket anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the great benefits of using an iPod was that I had complete control over my library. I decided what songs should be in my library not some algorithm. Since all the songs were stored locally, I could listen to my favoruite songs offline too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You needed to connect to a computer to download music to your iPod. Even though it may seem inconvenient, the process of loading music into the iPod was kind of fun. I usually would spend time adding metadata and album art to each track that I downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These days, using a streaming service like Spotify gets you access to millions of songs within seconds. I have discovered a lot of good songs thanks to the algorithm. But you don&amp;rsquo;t have full control or ownership of songs. Sometimes, the songs in your library may even vanish all of a sudden due to licensing agreements or the artist&amp;rsquo;s decision. Plus, these streaming services are a privacy nightmare and collect a lot of data about you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though the era of the mp3 players can be considered as dead, there are still a large number of people who prefer storing music locally on their device or hosting music on a server and this is analogous to using your own iPod or mp3 player.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I highly recommend you to check out Jeff Geerling&amp;rsquo;s video - &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDKvdlD6uQ&#34;&gt;Forget spaceships, I just want my music&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 31 of  &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Run an LLM with a single file</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/run-an-llm-with-single-file/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Jun 2024 11:59:00 +0530</pubDate><author>vachan@tutanota.com (Vachan S Panicker)</author>
      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/run-an-llm-with-single-file/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, I came across a video by NetworkChuck on &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjrdr0NU4Sk&#34;&gt;hosting AI locally&lt;/a&gt;. In short, he built a server specifically for running LLMs using Ollama and other tools. From his video I learned that running an LLM on your machine is actually not a complicated task.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But then a few weeks later, I discovered Mozilla&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://llamafile.ai/&#34;&gt;llamafile&lt;/a&gt; project which makes it even more easier to use LLMs on your computer. There is nothing to install. All you have to do is run a single file. It even comes with a web chat interface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the big advantages of using an LLM locally is privacy. Everything runs offline and you don&amp;rsquo;t need to worry about your data being used to train AI models.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To start using llamafile on Linux,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to the project&amp;rsquo;s repo by clicking &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#other-example-llamafiles&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and download the model you want to run. I downloaded &lt;code&gt;TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.F16.llamafile&lt;/code&gt; because of it&amp;rsquo;s relatively small size. Download the model which you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go to the folder where you downloaded your llamafile and open the terminal there. You will need to give permission to run the file so type the command below in the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;chmod +x TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.F16.llamafile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(If you downloaded a different model, remember to change the file name.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Run the file by entering the following command&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;./TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0.F16.llamafile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your browser should open automatically and that is all. If it doesn&amp;rsquo;t, go to http://localhost:8080/ . That is all. See how easy that was!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions are from the llamafile &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart&#34;&gt;quick start guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use a really old laptop and it was able to run the model alright. Sometimes, my desktop environment did freeze for a few moments. I actually was surprised that it was able to work on my machine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I hope you got a good idea on how simple it is to a run an LLM on your machine. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;llamafile.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Screenshot of the web interface of running a llamafile.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;The TinyLlama model running on my computer&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 30 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey&#xA;So I just wrapped up my fourth semester and I am so excited, relieved and thrilled. This semester was somewhat short - not even my teachers could cover the entire syllabus. On top of that, preparing for the final examinations was kind of stressful and I just finished my exams two days ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would consider this semester as a really boring semester, I really didn&amp;rsquo;t enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this semester, I studied&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Computer Organisation &amp;amp; Architecture (COA)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Operating Systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Graph Theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Database Managements Systems (DBMS)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Design &amp;amp; Engineering&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;COA is the subject that I found the most difficult. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t get myself to study it. DBMS on the other hand was actually manageable but it was really vast. Rest of the subjects were fine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So far, I am kind of disappointed with the course I am studying. It was always my dream from 10th grade to become a developer. But all I study in college is a bunch of theoretical stuff. To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to learn the inner workings of a computer. All I want to do is to create a cool app or a website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know&amp;hellip;.maybe there will be something for me in the upcoming semesters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-did-my-exams-go&#34;&gt;How did my exams go?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yeah&amp;hellip;.exams were alright. If you don&amp;rsquo;t know me, I am a person who learns everything in the last moment (Usually during the break before an exam).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I actually had plenty of days between exams so that was a big relief. But my university unexpectedly changed the entire examination timetable between our exams. This was a big slap in the face for everyone because it actually not only extended the whole examination period but also reduced the days between exams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me the sudden move made by the university was actually kind of a blessing because I got a few days to study for my engineering graphics supplementary paper. I am pretty sure I am going to pass the paper this time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember how I said that COA was the subject that I dread the most? Well, the COA paper was alright and I am confident that I am going to clear that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But out of all the exams, preparing for the Operating System paper was probably the most stressful because I had exactly one day to study five modules. Fortunately, I was actually able to cover about four modules and prepared for the exam pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few of my friends also had arranged online classes on Discord and this actually was super helpful. I was able to answer many of the questions in the exam just because of studying with my bros.&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;discord-class.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Screenshot of a voice chat with my friends on discord&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Group study with my friends on Discord&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the first two semesters, preparing for exams was hectic but by the fourth semester I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten good at handling exams. I even managed to squeeze in time to watch Back to the Future 2 &amp;amp; 3(the entire BTTF trilogy is awesome) between all this studying. I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that as long as I put in hard work and prepare well, there is no need to worry too much. I know I will be able pass my exams(hopefully😅).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 29 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>GoatCounter - Free &amp; Open-Source Web Analytics</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/goat-counter/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When people think about web analytics, Google Analytics is the first option that comes to mind.  It is one of the most widely used analytics tools on the web. It is free and has a lot of great features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It provides information about how long a person stays on your site, behaviour of the person on your site, bounce rate and so much more. Google Analytics can even show infomration in real-time. These features all sound cool but it comes it with a cost - your privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Plus, if you are running a simple blogsite like I am, do you really need all this data? Not really&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All I just want to know is if people are visiting my site without sacrificing the privacy of my visitors and me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Meet &lt;a href=&#34;https://goatcounter.com&#34;&gt;GoatCounter&lt;/a&gt;. It is a free, open-source, privacy respecting and self-hostable tool that I use on my site. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t use cookies or store your ip-address.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Martin Tournoij, the person behind GoatCounter specifically created it to track basic analytics on his personal website.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GoatCounter can collect data on referer header, screen size and country. You are in full control, so if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to record a specific information, you can turn it off. You can even decide on how long the collected data should be retained.&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;goatcounter.png&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Screenshot of the dashboard of goatcounter that displays graphs and information on how many people visited my website.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;GoatCounter&amp;rsquo;s dashboard&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The user interface is simple, clean and displays all the information in a single page. But I do think the dashboard could look a little bit more modern and attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been using GoatCounter for several months and I am really happy with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are many other alternative open source analytics tool but you usually have to pay or self-host the software. Plus, most of these other options are designed for businesses and marketplaces.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For getting a basic idea on traffic on your personal website, GoatCounter is a great option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 28 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Apps I use to stream music</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/apps-i-use-to-stream-music/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 13 Jun 2024 19:13:00 +0530</pubDate><author>vachan@tutanota.com (Vachan S Panicker)</author>
      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/apps-i-use-to-stream-music/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I listen to music all the time and here are the apps that I use to listen to and discover music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;rimusic&#34;&gt;RiMusic&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rimusic is a a great privacy-friendly app to stream music. It streams songs from YouTube Music without ads and is a fork of the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic/&#34;&gt;ViMusic&lt;/a&gt; app. It has a ton of features and is extremely customisable. You can download songs and the app even automatically caches songs. Rimusic also supports displaying lyrics for songs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The app also has a &amp;lsquo;For You&amp;rsquo; section that recommends songs according to your listening history. It works okay but isn&amp;rsquo;t as good as spotify or youtube music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, RiMusic is a solid app that does its job of streaming music really well and nothing else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can download RiMusic from &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/it.fast4x.rimusic/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;spotify&#34;&gt;Spotify&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I guess on hearing &amp;lsquo;Spotify&amp;rsquo;, you are all ready to come at me with pitchforks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main reason why I use Spotify is because I love their recommendation system. I have discovered a lot of great songs on Spotify. There are a lot of good playlists to match your mood and taste. As mentioned earlier, RiMusic isn&amp;rsquo;t good at personalised recommendations. But I haven&amp;rsquo;t abandoned RiMusic yet.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use the free plan and&amp;hellip;.boy&amp;hellip;the free plan just sucks. You can&amp;rsquo;t even play a playlist/album in order or even srub through songs. Even the shuffle button is paywalled. I wonder, will spotify even offer a free plan in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;rsquo;t let go of RiMusic yet. I still need it to listen to songs offline, play an album in the exact order and etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;soundcloud&#34;&gt;Soundcloud&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I see SoundCloud as a different type of streaming service. One of the cool things about SoundCloud is that anyone can upload songs to the platform. It is a great place to find mashups, bootlegs and remixes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I personally use it to listen to music while am studying. It has a large library of library of lofi and instrumental tracks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soundcloud is also great for discovering EDM, techno and bass boosted songs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yeah so these are the services I use. How do you listen to music? I&amp;rsquo;d love to know. Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 27 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100DaystoOffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/where-i-have-been/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I know it has been a while since I have written a blog post. I only wrote four posts last month and I am super behind the #100DaystoOffload challenge. Here is what happened&amp;hellip;.(this is probably the most boring post I have written..hehe)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago my brother spilled coffee on my laptop and it completely ruined my external keyboard. Some of the keys were dead and it was basically impossible to type with. The scroll wheel of my mouse also didn&amp;rsquo;t work properly. This really frustrated me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, I am also busy with my fourth semester examinations, so I just haven&amp;rsquo;t been in the mood to write posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For a few weeks, I stopped using my laptop and used my phone instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I went on amazon and bought a new keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is just an ordinary plastic one but it is bigger than my previous keyboard and even splash-proof.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, tomorrow, I have an exam and I haven&amp;rsquo;t even started studying yet&amp;hellip;lol. After, this exam, I have two more exams to write.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once my exams are over, I will be on a month long break and that means I will be able to spend more time writing. Wish me luck guys!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 26 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Configuring my router</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/configuring-my-router/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2024 21:37:00 +0530</pubDate><author>vachan@tutanota.com (Vachan S Panicker)</author>
      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/configuring-my-router/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I got my hands on a new used router and I spend some time configuring it. Lets go!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turned off WPS&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;WPS is a feature which allowed you to connect to a network without having to enter a password. All you had to do was push the WPS button on the router and enter WPS mode on your phone or device and tada!. You are connected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The big problem is that anyone who has physical access to your router can just push the button and connect. I once remember my friend who came to my home and went straight for the router without asking me the password or anything and connected his device to it by using the WPS button. This kinda freaked me out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But now, WPS is considered insecure and everyone recommends you to turn it off. If you still have it turned on, disable it. Newer devices don&amp;rsquo;t even have the option to use WPS.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changed the DNS Servers&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I changed my default DNS servers to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.quad9.net/&#34;&gt;Quad9 DNS&lt;/a&gt;. The DNS server provided by your ISP may be slow so it is a good reason to change it. I specifically chose Quad9 as it has good malware blocking so that I can browse the web safe and secure. You can use other options like Cloudflare, NextDNS and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Changed the default SSID and password and changed the credentials for the admin panel&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is really obvious. Using the default password provided by the ISP and the default credentials provided by the router manufacturer is not a good practice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Disable uPnP&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;uPnp is short for Universal plug and play and I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what it is or use it. So I disabled that as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Connected my printer&#xA;I also connected my dumb USB HP Printer to the router and now my printer acts like a wireless printer. This is probably the thing I am most happy about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The router I used earlier did not have a USB port. But now with my current router, I can print documents over the network&amp;hellip;Yay!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so these are all the small changes I made. I wish I could configure a guest network but that is not a feature on my router model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the future, I might get my hands on a router which can run OpenWRT so I can have more control.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What settings do you change when you get a new router? I would love to know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 25 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/april-review/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, I did not publish a month in review because I was just feeling lazy (lol). So I have packed things I did in the last two months in this post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;college&#34;&gt;College&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classes are going alright. I don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy this semester. It is so hot and sitting in class in this heat is just unbearable. There is no other option but just to adjust to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also had my internal exams and scored decent marks. But I am find it tough to study the paper - Computer Organization &amp;amp; Architecture.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;updates-to-the-site&#34;&gt;Updates to the site&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As you can see, I have switched to a new domain &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan-maker.github.io&#34;&gt;vachan.me&lt;/a&gt; which I am super thrilled about. But I don&amp;rsquo;t really know what I will do when it expires next year. It was included for free in the Github Student Pack.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You also probably noticed the 🥳 emoji in the nav bar. When you click on it, party mode is activated. Wohooo! You can click on it as much as you want. I am planning on adding even more easter eggs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;movies&#34;&gt;Movies&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GoatLife (Aadujeevitham)&lt;/strong&gt;: I watched GoatLife, a malayalam survival film, directed by Blessy. GoatLife is based on the novel of the same name by Benyamin. The movie was okay. I just felt like there was something missing. It didn&amp;rsquo;t really have that punch or emotional impact. Yes, Blessy and the entire crew worked really hard at making the film but it could have been better. It is a decent one time watch movie.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Premalu&lt;/strong&gt;: Premalu is a romantic comedy film starring Naslen and Mamitha Baiju. I think I watched the movie the day after watching GoatLife. This one was fun and a delight to watch. It&amp;rsquo;s the usual guy has a cursh on a girl plot but with good humour. Premalu is a great choice to watch with friends and family.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;music&#34;&gt;Music&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last month, I listened to a lot of songs by Coldplay, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Oliva Rodrigo and Ariana Grande.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I re-discovered the song Welcome to My Island and Bunny Is a Rider by Caroline Polachek.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;results&#34;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Results of the third semester was published recently and I passed all subjects. Yayy! Now in a few more days, I will be writing fourth semester exams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;finishing-thoughts&#34;&gt;Finishing Thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think that is all the pretty much things I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am behind the 100 Days to Offload Challenge. I need to push more posts to my blog to finish the challenge within a year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So that is all. Have a great day people!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 24 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Manjummel Boys</title>

      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/manjummel-boys/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;2024 seems to be a good year for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_cinema&#34;&gt;malayalam cinema&lt;/a&gt; industry. A lot of great movies came out this year. (I haven&amp;rsquo;t watched all of them yet)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So today right after I came back from college, I decided to watch the malayalam survival-thriller movie &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26458038/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manjummel Boys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on my phone. I have been eagerly waiting to watch this movie since its release in February. It was really popular and received positive reviews from people during its theatrical run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Manjummel Boys&lt;/em&gt; is based on a real-life incident. A group of friends go on a trip to &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal&#34;&gt;Kodaikkanal&lt;/a&gt; but then things take a wild turn when one of them falls into a pit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was left on the edge of my seat while I was watching this. The movie was highly engaging from the start and I lost track how much time had passed. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my phone down.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, as I watched the movie, I felt a mix of emotions. Many moments in the film made me cry. It delivered great levels of anxiety, fear and intensity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition, friendship is a strong theme throughout the film and I could totally relate to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cinematography and production was top-notch. Ajayan Chalissery did an excellent job in designing and making a realistic replica of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna_Caves&#34;&gt;Guna Caves&lt;/a&gt;. But I do feel like the VFX could have been more realsitic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To wrap things up, &lt;em&gt;Manjummel Boys&lt;/em&gt; is a an awesome thriller movie. It is definetly a must watch. I would have enjoyed this movie even more, if I had watched this in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have seen it, I would love to hear from you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Btw, this is my first film review, if you have any feedback, please e-mail me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 23 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I created my google account all the way back in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came to know about how mega companies like Meta, Google and Microsoft track every single thing that you do and how they violate your privacy. I watched a lot of videos from Youtube channels such as Techlore and The Hated One.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This all happened in 2020 during the lockdown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I deleted my instagram account, created a Tutanota and Protonmail account and started to use front-ends for sites like YouTube and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But four years later, I still haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to stop using my google account. I had made a decision to slowly migrate from my Google account but that never happened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-why-havent-i-switched&#34;&gt;So why haven&amp;rsquo;t I switched?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer is simple. It is because of all the apps and services provided by Google are free, easy and convenient to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am also kind of lazy to do it because the whole switching process doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen with the snap of a finger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I backup my data on my phone to google drive, store documents and other files in drive, edit documents on Google Docs and store photos on google photos.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we all know when you are not paying for it, you are the product.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many of you reading this will probably want to ask me &amp;lsquo;Why not just self-host?&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would really love to self host apps like NextCloud but I just don&amp;rsquo;t have the money to set up a server.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Buying a rasberry pi in India is expensive and I would also have to spend more money on storage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, there are free third-party instances of Nextcloud and free cloud storage providers like Mega. But I don&amp;rsquo;t want to use those. If I am going to switch, I want to use software which I have control over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;final-thoughts&#34;&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am just going to keep using my Google account for now(I don&amp;rsquo;t really have any other option). But in the future when I have the money, I will definetly switch to self hosted appplications. It is something that I am very eager to use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 22 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100DaystoOffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Just start blogging</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a couple of months since I launched this blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was initially hesitant to start blogging because I would ask myself &amp;lsquo;What should I write about?&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;Will anyone read what I write?&amp;rsquo;. Also the thought &amp;rsquo;nothing interesting really happens in my life&amp;rsquo; held me back from blogging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But as I began to write and publish posts, I started to realize that I have experiences, thoughts and other things that I want to share with people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occassionally, something would happen in my life or I would do something that was worthy to be written about. I have published posts on topics which I never expected to write about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not only that, a few people also read my posts, which I am happy about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you are stuck on deciding whether to start blogging or not, don&amp;rsquo;t be confused. Setup a blog and start writing. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXsQAXx_ao0&#34;&gt;Do it. Just do it.&lt;/a&gt; You will naturally discover ideas and topics to write on along the way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have time, do check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://startafuckingblog.com/&#34;&gt;Start a fucking blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 21 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is my bucket list. It is not complete, I will keep on adding things to it. Some of the items are completely random and crazy. (Maybe I won&amp;rsquo;t update it or I will probably end up deleting this)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I want to go skydiving/parachuting(really scared to do it though)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Fly in a helicopter&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Develop an app and publish it on the play store&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Write software that will be used by a lot of people&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Create a video game&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit Jammu and Kashmir and other famous places in India&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go on a long trip on my bike&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Visit a country in each continent (I don&amp;rsquo;t think this is going to happen&amp;hellip;hehe)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Go to Japan and visit Tokyo&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Workout and get a six pack&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I know the basics of playing the piano (not good at it though). But I want to improve my musical knowledge, learn other instruments and maybe even release an original song.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Buy a poweful laptop&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Build a desktop PC&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make a robot&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Own a house&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Set up a mini home theater in my house&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Talk and hangout with a famous person&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is all that comes to my mind now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So do you have a bucket list? I would love to know.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 20 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This isn&amp;rsquo;t a promotional post or anything&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During lunch break, free period or on the bus, my friends and I play Mini Militia. It is a 2D multiplayer shooting game. We play it over LAN wifi(by connecting to the hostpot of the host).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What makes the game good is that it is simple, fun and runs on pretty much every device.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mini Militia used to be really popular a few years ago. But after the launch of games like PUBG and Gareena Free Fire and also due to the lockdown, the popularity of the game decreased. Miniclip purchasing Mini Militia from the original developers and adding ads also resulted in the downfall.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My friends and I use the old version of the game because the version on the playstore sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I am not a mobile gamer. But I got into playing the game and now I just love playing it. There are about 15 of us in our class who play it. Like I mentioned earlier, whenever we have some free time, we will all just play. Some of my friends are pros at playing Mini Militia, they easily get more than 20 kills in a match. When I first started, I got killed the most but now I am getting better at it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The game has several maps and two main modes - death match and capture the flag. Usually, we play capture the flag when there is a lot of people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After two or three matches in a row,the game does get repetetive and becomes boring. So most of us just stop and do something else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So is there a game that you love playing with your friends? Let me know!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 19 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>I tried Youtube Premium</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/i-tried-youtube-premium/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 12 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vachan@tutanota.com (Vachan S Panicker)</author>
      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/i-tried-youtube-premium/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In November of last year, my friends and I decided to subscribe to YouTube premium family plan. We split the cost of Rs. 189 per month and each of us had to pay Rs. 30 each. (This is clearly against YouTube&amp;rsquo;s terms of service, but who cares)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But a few weeks ago, I went ahead and left the family group and stopped paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My friends and I subscribed to premium because of its benefits and I really wanted to try premium out. Having a subscription, allows you to pause a video on a device and resume the video from another device, no ads, background play, smart downloads and my favorite perk - full access to YT Music. YouTube also claims that by using Premium, you also support the content creators on ther platform(I have my doubts regarding that). Still, for 30 rupees a month, it is actually a really good deal.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might wonder &amp;ldquo;Why I didn&amp;rsquo;t use Invidious or Newpipe?&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Why not use Ublock origin?&amp;rdquo;. Yes, I had used all of these before subscribing to YT premium. Ublock does a great job in blocking ads in the browser. However, on my phone, NewPipe and LibreTube just wouldn&amp;rsquo;t work that well. Sometimes a video would not load or the app would crash. This really annoyed me!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once I signed up for premium, my daily watch time increased.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-why-did-i-cancel-my-subscription&#34;&gt;So why did I cancel my subscription?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The thing I hate most about YouTube is &amp;lsquo;Shorts&amp;rsquo;. I wish it was a seperate app or there was a way to turn it off without having to pause my watch history. I ended up wasting a good chunk of time watching shorts and normal videos. I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t control myself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I went ahead and uninstalled the app from my phone. As a result, my video consumption reduced drastically. If I want to watch something now, I either use youtube in my browser or use NewPipe and LibreTube. (these apps still have some problems.) Since I didn&amp;rsquo;t watch a ton of videos anymore, I saw no real value in paying money to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For listening to music, I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/it.fast4x.rimusic/&#34;&gt;RiMusic&lt;/a&gt; from F-Droid. It is a fork of the awesome &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/it.vfsfitvnm.vimusic/&#34;&gt;ViMusic&lt;/a&gt; app and I am really happy with using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TLDR, I cancelled my subcription because I uninstalled the app from my phone to control my watch time. As a result, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t worth it to continue paying for the subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 18 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>Making a donut in Blender</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/donut-in-blender/</link>

      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/donut-in-blender/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My classmate Thomas is a blender artist. His renders are pretty good and it inspred me to learn &lt;a href=&#34;https://blender.org&#34;&gt;blender&lt;/a&gt;, a free and open source 3D graphics software.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In October of 2023, I started to watch &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/@blenderguru&#34;&gt;Blender Guru&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; Donut tutorial. Apparently, making a donut is the first thing most newbies do. &amp;lsquo;It is like the &amp;ldquo;hello world&amp;rdquo; in programming but for Blender&amp;rsquo;. (from youtube comment section)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Creating a donut gives you a pretty good idea about some of the most commonly used tools and things you can do in Blender.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I started following along the videos, I began to realize that creating a donut was more dfficult that I had expected. Sometimes I would mess things up and had to watch the videos again and again. Sometimes, I even had to start all the way from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After a while, I got really frustrated and decided to just quit because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get rid of clipping on my icing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;donutstopped.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Render of a donut with clipping on icing&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;I think this is the stage where I stopped working on the donut&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two or three weeks before, Thomas told me that Blender Guru had released a brand new updated donut tutorial and asked me to give it a try again. Not only that but Blender 4.0 was also released. So I decided to start again.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMO, I found the new tutorial much more easier to follow along. In this one, the donut guy also explained some of the common problems people face and how it could be fixed. Furthermore, the comment section was really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the fascinating aspect of working with Blender is that &amp;lsquo;imperfection is the digital perfection&amp;rsquo;. In the case of a donut, we start out with a shape called a &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus&#34;&gt;torus&lt;/a&gt;. It is a perfect shape. But for our render to be more realistic and interesting, we have to add imperfections like bumps and asymmetry to it. When putting the sprinkles on the donut, the colors, material and the distribution of sprinkles should not be predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My laptop is an old machine and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really have the horsepower to do heavy work like this. Blender crashed when I tried to add an image texture on the rectangular slab. Anyway here is the render (yes, the ligting is not proper, I will fix it).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;donut.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Render of two donuts. Both donuts are next to each other and have a pink colored icing on top. One of the donuts have a long sprinkles while the other one has round multicolored sprinkles&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Delicious donuts!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-next&#34;&gt;So what is next?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am learning Blender just for fun. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a professional or anything. I just want to create some renders and share it with my friends. Next, I am planning on creating a low poly car.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am really happy I was able to go so far in the tutorial. There is still a few more parts I need to watch to complete the tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have time, you should try to create one as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 17 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I started using Mastodon account 4 years ago, what really caught my attention was that most of the people on it  had their own personal website. This was really cool!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I started my website at the end of last year. Since then, I have spent quite a lot of time writing posts and designing my website. Working on my blog has taught me so much!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First of all, I want people to learn something new from my website. I would like my site to be like a library. The content in here should inspire a person to try something new (it could be an app,a project, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My website is a combination of things I have learned from looking at other individuals websites and reading their posts. It was because of users on Mastodon that I really felt the urge to create this site. It was because of someone who decided to write that post on &amp;lsquo;adding a last modified date or setting up a recent posts section&amp;rsquo; that I now have these implemented on my site. Like this, I want to do the same thing to others.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am also planning on set up a wiki as well so that I can share the things I learn and refer back to it when I need to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I wish to showcase my skills and some of the small projects that I have done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the above, I really want to write and publish a lot of posts here. That is why I decided to participate in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt; challenge. I want to write posts about a lot of things (about my college, exams, good memories, new things I learned and so on) and not just technical posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the future, I hope to come back to the posts that I wrote and be like &amp;ldquo;Hey, that was really cool!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Those were some good times&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done that&amp;rdquo; and relive those moments.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, I am not a good writer but I really hope to improve my writing skills and improve my vocabulary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, so that is really all&amp;hellip;. I just want to help people and enjoy working on improving my space on the web.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 16 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100Daystooffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a note to myself&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday I had my COA (Computer Organisation &amp;amp; Architecture) exam and I didn&amp;rsquo;t perform well on it. The questions asked were direct and pretty easy. But unortunately, I forgot many of the things I learned when writing the exam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;COA is the most difficult subject for me in this semester.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our teacher didn&amp;rsquo;t give us any important questions but from looking through previous year university question papers, I actually had an idea of what questions I could expect for the exam. I studied by referring to my lecture notes, youtube videos and notes that our teacher gave us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the exam, I understood that I actually still didn&amp;rsquo;t have a good grip on the topics. When I saw the question paper, I was like &amp;ldquo;hey these are the same questions I learned the night before. This is easy!&amp;rdquo;. But when I started answering a question, I would get stuck and wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to complete it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem was that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t put effort into understanding the concepts clearly. I felt like I understood the topic when I watched the videos and read the notes, but in reality I hadn&amp;rsquo;t. I should have closed the book, taken a piece of paper, tried to recollect what I had learned, cleared all the doubts and strengthened my understanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, last minute cramming is not good. It is important to revise the concepts on the same day it is taught. (But I cram everything a day or two before the exam. I seriously need to break from this bad habit.) Yeah, you might be able to score marks by studying in the last minute. But remember that you will most likely not be able to retain the things you learn in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time this is happening. That is why I decided to write a post about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are still reading this, don&amp;rsquo;t be like me. Study and revise topics properly and don&amp;rsquo;t study just for passing an exam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 15 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100Daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;concert3.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;A group of people standing on stage with instruments in a concert.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Jassie Gift and team on stage&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;So day before yesterday (Sat March 16, 2024) our college arts fest came to an end. The name of the arts festival this year was &amp;lsquo;Thira&amp;rsquo;. Last year the name was &amp;lsquo;Drishya&amp;rsquo;. (Yes, every year there is a different name). It lasted three days. Thira 2K24 was inaugurated by an alumnus of our college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a tech fest was held a day before arts. This year there was no tech fest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite several challenges, our seniors did a great job in hosting the event. The campus was decorated and the events and competitions were all good. Also, the newly constructed open air auditorium was inaugurated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I went only on the first and second day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There were a lot of competitions - some of them were &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam&#34;&gt;Bharatanatyam&lt;/a&gt;, Couples dance, group dance, band performance, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanchippattu&#34;&gt;Vanchipattu&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppana&#34;&gt;Oppana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffmuttu&#34;&gt;Duffmuttu&lt;/a&gt;. There were also writing and drawing competitions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main highlight of arts fest and what everyone eagerly waited for was the music concert. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jassie_Gift&#34;&gt;Jassie Gift&lt;/a&gt;, a Malayalam playback singer, was the main performer this year. Last year, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fejo_(rapper)&#34;&gt;Fejo&lt;/a&gt; came to our college.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concert was awesome and we all had a great time. Jassie Gift came with band and the group performed a lot of great songs (malayalam, hindi and tamil songs). The sound and the lights elevated the whole concert.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Most of the photos in this post were taken by my friends.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Podcast Episode: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObYkyZtHdgI&#34;&gt;When Scammers Call, He Strikes Back In the Best Way🎙Darknet Diaries Ep. 143: Jim Hates Scams&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So usually I listen to music before going to sleep. Yesterday, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel like listening to songs so I went ahead and decided to listen to a podcast called &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darknet_Diaries&#34;&gt;Darknet Diaries&lt;/a&gt;. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t heard about the podcast until yesterday and it mainly focuses on real incidents in the cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I listened to the most recent &lt;a href=&#34;https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/143/&#34;&gt;episode&lt;/a&gt; of the podcast (March 5, 2024) which featured &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Browning_(YouTuber)&#34;&gt;Jim Browning&lt;/a&gt;. You probably have heard of him. He is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBNG0osIBAprVcZZ3ic84vw&#34;&gt;YouTuber&lt;/a&gt; and a software engineer and his work involves investigating online scams and exposing scammers and their operations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scammers use social engineering, scripts and software tools to trick the person on the other end of the phone. Usually a scammer will try to trick someone into thinking there is something wrong with their computer and steal money from them. (There are many other type of scams as well like refund scams)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The work that Jim does and the videos that he publishes on YouTube raise awareness of different scam operations and are entertaining to watch as well. He also has helped several people from not being victim to scams.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the incidents Jim shared on the podcast was actually pretty funny. He hacked into one of the scammer&amp;rsquo;s computer and got a list of all the real names and the fake names of all the people working in the scam call center. He then called the scammer by their real name. All the scammers in the room were taken by surprise and their reactions were amusing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another time, he actually was able to access the CCTV camera feeds of a scam centre and see everything going inside.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could keep going on and on. The episode is an hour long and is definetly worth the listen. This is the first episode of Darknet Diaries that I listened to and I really liked it!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just wanted to share this with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 13 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>I don&#39;t use read receipts</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;From the day I created my WhatsApp account, I&amp;rsquo;ve always kept read receipts off and never really felt the need to turn them on. Some of my friends don&amp;rsquo;t really get why I do this and often ask me about it. This is like a response post to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whenever I message someone, I don&amp;rsquo;t expect an immediate reply and I am perfectly fine with them replying back a day or two later or not even replying at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes one of my friends will send me a couple of voice messages and often I might be in a place or situation where I cannot listen to what they have to say, so I just respond back a few hours later.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Turning off the blue tick mark also gives me some time to think and respond to a message without making the person on the other end feel bad. It reduces the pressure on me to reply immediately to someone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But there is another thing. Pretty much all of my friends know that I am a very active user. I post statuses for fun on WhatsApp, send messages and make stupid jokes in group chats nearly daily. In addition to that, there is no way to turn off read receipts for group chats on the app. If I don&amp;rsquo;t respond to a person, they probably know that I have seen their messages and ignoring them on purpose. So I will have to reply back to them no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, turning off read receipts just allows me to think and respond back to a person at my own pace. Rest assured, I will reply back to their message or atleast give a reaction to let them know that I have seen what they sent.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 12 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;sugarcane2.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;A hand holding a glass filled to the brim with cold sugarcane juice made from sugarcane, lemon juice,ginger and sugar. There is also a paper straw in the glass.&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;A glass of refreshing sugar cane juice&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;Huh it&amp;rsquo;s already March. That was fast! And the heat is just unbearable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had my third semester lab exams (OOP in Java &amp;amp; Data Structures) at the beginning of this month and I was really anxious about it because this was actually my first lab exam. There were a lot of programs to study and I thought I would blank out at the middle of writing a program and or not even know how to do a program the examiner asked. But thankfully, I was able to perform pretty well in the exam and got the output for both the labs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day coincided with my data structure exam and on the day before it, I discovered a site called the love calculator created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://aldrinjenson.com/&#34;&gt;Aldrin Jenson&lt;/a&gt;. It asked the person who their crush is and after submitting the form it rickrolls the person. I really loved this harmless prank and decided to create a clone of it. It was really fun to make and I got good responses from my friends. You can read more about it &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/posts/pranking-my-friends-on-valentines-day/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since answer sheet evaluation was taking place, our college gave us a short break.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;maramon.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;On the sanbed of Maramon&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;On the sanbed of Maramon&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maramon_Convention&#34;&gt;Maramon Convention&lt;/a&gt;, a week long Chrisitian convention held every year began that week and I went there and atteneded a few sessions. I also met a good number of people there.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent the rest of the days working on redesigning this website. Initially, I created this website using a theme called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nightfall&#34;&gt;Nightfall&lt;/a&gt;. It is an alright theme but there were a some things about it which I didn&amp;rsquo;t like. I was able to fix most of the issues but in the end I decided to go with a new custom design. If you want to know more, check the post I wrote about the process. On top of that, this site has new pages like a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/now&#34;&gt;Now&lt;/a&gt; page,&#xA;and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/links&#34;&gt;Links&lt;/a&gt; page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also accidentally binge watched &lt;a href=&#34;https://anilist.co/anime/20958/Attack-on-Titan-Season-2/&#34;&gt;Attack on Titan season 2&lt;/a&gt; and completed the season in a day. The show caught my attention and I just couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop watching it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After the short vacation, classes began again. Compared to the previous semester, this sem is actually pretty boring. I am also finding a paper called Computer Organisation Architecture somewhat difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 11 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to know coding to contribute to open source software. Here are some ways you can make a contribution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Pretty much all open source projects have an issue tracker. It is primarily used for bug reporting. So if you find a bug while using a software, report the bug to the maintainers by creating an issue. If you have an idea for a new feature or how an existing feature can be improved, open a feature request.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you are a designer, you could help out a project by designing icons, logos, promotional materials and branding. You can also work on enchancing the user interface or user experience of a project.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can help in writing documentation and tutorials. Having a good and clear documentation will help newcomers and users understand how the software works and what features and options are available. It will also help users troubleshoot issues that they may face.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Help translate or localize the software or documentation to your language. Localization increases accessibility and inclusiveness.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Help people who use the software and answer questions that they have on the project&amp;rsquo;s forum site, issue tracker, subreddit or chatroom.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You can show your support and appreciation by making a donation to the project. Donating money can help ensure sustainability, development and maintenance of the software and its supporting infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you enjoy using the software, share it with your friends and family.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If you love organizing events and programs then you can help the project out by hosting conferences, meetups, hackathons and workshops.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think, I missed something, send me an email or write a reply post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 10 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100daystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currenly enjoying a short break from college and I used the time for revamping my website. I did change the appearence of this site a few weeks ago but that was nothing major. I wanted my website to have a little bit more of a personal touch.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole process actually took a lot more time than I expected and it is still not complete.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The site now has a new color scheme - a really nice teal color palette. I actually came across the palette while going through Tailwind CSS documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole website is a culmination of things I love from blogs of other people.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://simplecss.orgs&#34;&gt;Simple.css&lt;/a&gt; is used as the base for typograhy and spacing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might think &amp;lsquo;why does the navigation menu looks so familiar?&amp;rsquo;. Well, it is copied from &lt;a href=&#34;https://joelchrono.xyz&#34;&gt;Joel Chrono&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also referred to the sites of &lt;a href=&#34;https://kevq.uk&#34;&gt;Kev Quirk&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://rknight.me/&#34;&gt;Robb Knight&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://arun.blog&#34;&gt;Arun&lt;/a&gt; and  &lt;a href=&#34;https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/&#34;&gt;Simone Silvestroni&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The text (വചൻ) above the navigation bar is actually my name written in &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam&#34;&gt;Malayalam&lt;/a&gt;, my mother tongue. The font used is &lt;a href=&#34;https://rachana.org.in/glist-kutty-bold.html&#34;&gt;RIT Kutty Bold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also added some new pages.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/now&#34;&gt;now&lt;/a&gt; page tells you what I am  doing now.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/uses&#34;&gt;Uses&lt;/a&gt; page tells you what hardware and software I use.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/faves&#34;&gt;faves&lt;/a&gt; page for sharing the music, tv-shows and movies I like. It is not complete.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A &lt;a href=&#34;https://vachan.me/&#34;&gt;home&lt;/a&gt; page with two photos and some of my recent posts. Earlier my homepage just displayed my name and the link of my social media handles. I have moved that to the contact page, which is also new.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthere more, I added &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goatcounter.com/&#34;&gt;goatcounter&lt;/a&gt; analytics to get an idea on how many people visit my site. There is also now a reply via email button at the bottom of every post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The whole process taught me a lot. Even though I reused most of the hugo code from the previous theme, I got a good grip on how Hugo works - about partials, pipes, directory structure, etc. I also gained insight on working with branches in git and using Sass for styling.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really love how everything looks in the end. If you have any feedback, please feel free to get in touch with me.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20240211020308/https://vachan-maker.github.io/&#34;&gt;Old design of this site&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 9 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100daystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>I liked Google plus and miss it</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%2B&#34;&gt;Google Plus (G+)&lt;/a&gt; was a social media site created by Google. It was shut down in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I created my account back in August of 2014 when I was in either fourth grade or fifth grade - I don&amp;rsquo;t remember which.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was actually super excited to create my account and told my parents about my account after I created it and they were actually OK with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Google was really trying hard to get people to use G+ and it was tightly integrated to pretty much all other google apps. The company was really forcing users to use it and I decided to give it a try.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the standout features was circles which  allowed you to group people into different groups. So you could share a post with a specific list of people. That was pretty cool! Also, instead of a like button, it had a +1 button.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some of my friends from church used Google plus and we would share memes, funny videos and so on. I would jump on G+ every single day and was really active on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I even remember creating a page just for sharing funny posts. Only like 5 people followed it. lol.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was part of the Minecraft community and would post some of my creations to the community. There were many other communities as well. I also was part of the clash of clans community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another great feature of Google plus was their android app. It offered a solid experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite Google forcing people to use the platform, not many people actually used it. Instagram and Facebook attracted much more users. Nevertheless, I had a good time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, google shut down the service in 2019. Google did allow users to download all the posts and data but unfortunately, I never downloaded the data which now I regret.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So did you actually use Google+ back then? What did you think of it? I would love to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 8 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;https://love-calc-project.netlify.app/&#34;&gt;Love Calculator&lt;/a&gt; before reading the post!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Isn&amp;rsquo;t it great? lol&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;rsquo;t check it out, basically it is a website that asks a person who their crush is and tries to calculate their love percentage. But in the end it just &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling&#34;&gt;rickrolls&lt;/a&gt; the person.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This not my idea but I stole it from a guy named Aldrin, who made this for April Fools Day. You can check out his project &lt;a href=&#34;https://aldrinjenson.github.io/Love-Calc/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I came across Aldrin&amp;rsquo;s work on the eve of Valentine&amp;rsquo;s day and I really wanted to make something like this. Knowing that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t take too long, I started to work on it immediately. I had a lab exam the next day, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spend too much time with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I created two HTML files, added a dummy form and used &lt;a href=&#34;https://simplecss.org&#34;&gt;simple.css&lt;/a&gt; . For the second page, I embeded some funny gifs from GIPHY and Rick Astley&amp;rsquo;s Never Gonna Give You Up from SoundCloud. Voila! It&amp;rsquo;s done.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well, it didn&amp;rsquo;t work very well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The SoundCloud embed loaded slowly and sometimes the song didn&amp;rsquo;t autoplay even though I had enabled autoplay for the widget. To fix this, I downloaded the song and used the HTML &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; autoplay attribute instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let the fun begin!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I put the link as my status on WhatsApp and shared it to a few of my friends. Since, the form didn&amp;rsquo;t actually submit responeses, I had no clue how many people used it. But some of my friends messaged me and they liked it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;love-calculator-20-&#34;&gt;Love Calculator 2.0 🤣️🤣️&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After my exam, I decided to improve it and have more fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use Netlify for hosting the project and one of the cool features Netlify offers is form handling. It is super easy to use and free!. So I added this feature to the form.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also replaced the GIPHY embeds with .webp files.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, let the fun begin, again!! hehe&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I posted the link again as my status and one of my friends posted it in our main college class WhatsApp group.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the responses, about 30 in total, were really funny.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I had a really great time with this love calculator thing. It was really fun!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 7 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I still find it hard to believe that I am already in the fourth semester. After two or three months, I will be stepping into my third year in college. Time sure flies!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The semester actually began on the 29th of January, about six days after my third sem final exams. So there wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a long break or anything. Not  only that but I also had to write a supplementary exam for Engineering Graphics on the 30th. Unfortunately, I did not perform well in the exam. So I will most likely be attending the exam again in this sem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though the third semester was completed, our lab exams for it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been completed and is scheduled to start in the first week of February. So I was busy writing the records during the short break.&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;hehe.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Image caption: bollywood mode turned on&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Image caption: bollywood mode turned on&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this semester, I have to learn the following courses&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Database Management System&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Graph Theory&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Operating Systems&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Computer Organisation &amp;amp; Architechture&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Constitution of India&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Design &amp;amp; Engineering&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also have 2 labs - Operating system &amp;amp; digital electronics&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Classes are going alright. It still hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten serious. Usually in the afternoon, we get free periods.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also started playing volleyball with my friends during lunch break in the scorching sun. It is fun. :)&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;volleyball.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;Image caption: playing volleyball&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Image caption: playing volleyball&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;goals--for-this-term&#34;&gt;Goals  for this term&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These are some things I want to accomplish by the end of this term.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Make a small web app for saving my friends birthdays.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Its been a quite some time, since I last used Flutter and I want to make another simple app with it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Learn more about data structures and algorithms.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maybe apply for an internship?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Clear my engineering graphics exam. This time I am going study for it properly.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping Up&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Overall, I hope this semester will go smoothly for me and I will be able to score good grades. Plus, I aspire on improving my coding skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 6 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100daystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>How I keep track of tv shows, anime and movies</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/how-i-keep-track-of-tv-shows-and-movies/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 06 Feb 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>vachan@tutanota.com (Vachan S Panicker)</author>
      <guid>https://vachan.me/posts/how-i-keep-track-of-tv-shows-and-movies/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Before joining college, I usually didn&amp;rsquo;t watch any TV shows or anime and I would watch a movie only once in a while. However after entering college, I discovered that most of my friends were really into shows and anime and they would urge me to watch stuff.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I watched episodes from different shows, I often lost track of which episode I watched last. So, I searched for a good TV trackng service. Here is what I found:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tv-shows--movies&#34;&gt;TV Shows &amp;amp; Movies&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;trakt&#34;&gt;Trakt&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For tracking TV Shows and movies (no anime here), I use a platform called &lt;a href=&#34;https://trakt.tv&#34;&gt;Trakt&lt;/a&gt; and it is great. Trakt can also help you share and discover new content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trakt has an official mobile app for Android and iOS. But there are also a bunch of third party apps from the community. I personlly use an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/1RandomDev/showly-oss&#34;&gt;Showly&lt;/a&gt; on my Android phone. Whenever, I finish watching an episode or movie, I open the app and mark the episode or movie as watched. Then the app syncs the data instantly with Trakt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Trakt also gives useul insights like the most watched genere, amount of time watched and presents the data beautifully.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;simkl--tmdb&#34;&gt;Simkl &amp;amp; TMDB&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://simkl.com/&#34;&gt;Simkl&lt;/a&gt; just for backing up my data from Trakt.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.themoviedb.org/&#34;&gt;TMDB&lt;/a&gt; is used for creating custom lists, as Trakt doesn&amp;rsquo;t allow unlimited lists in their free plan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;anime&#34;&gt;Anime&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://anilist.co/&#34;&gt;Anilist&lt;/a&gt; is the platform of my choice for tracking anime. There are a quite a good number of other anime trackers as well. Use whatever you feel is comfortable for you. I really love the interface of Anilist, it is clean and simple.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to see my profile, you can check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://anilist.co/user/vchn/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Since I am not a huge fan, I only watch anime sometimes. There isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything on my profile. If you look careully, you can see that I still haven&amp;rsquo;t finished Death Note. Hehe:)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;dont-get-too-carried-away&#34;&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t get too carried away&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One of the problems with using these kind of tracking services is that you will probably end up watching several episodes and movies and in the end waste your precious time. I have been using Trakt for several months and there have been instances where I would binge-watch TV shows and movies just to boost my watch time statistics. At one point, I was obsessed with updating my watchlist, marking episodes as watched and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 5 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com&#34;&gt;#100daystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>A fresh coat of paint</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you didn&amp;rsquo;t know already, my website is built using &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;, a static site generator and I use a theme called Nightfall. Although the theme is simple and clean, there were some things which really bothered me. However, I have resolved most of the issues and thought I would share what I did with you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;For navigation on mobile devices, a hamburger menu was used. Currently, I only have two links in my nav bar and there isn&amp;rsquo;t a need for me to use it. Plus, these menus are not accessible to all. So I decided to remove it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;All links are now underlined and have a contrasting colour.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Typography has improved! Now, the body text uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/general-sans&#34;&gt;GeneralSans&lt;/a&gt; font, which I discovered after browsing &lt;a href=&#34;https://kevquirk.com/&#34;&gt;Kev Quirk&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; website. The font size and line height has also changed.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I also made some changes to the structure of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML&#34;&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; files. Some of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div&#34;&gt;div&lt;/a&gt; classes have been replaced with &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/semantics#semantics_in_html&#34;&gt;semantic elements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making and testing these changes did take a few hours. But I am happy how it turned out in the end. If you have any suggestions, please do send me an e-mail or message me through Mastodon.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Edit(Feb 3, 2024) : If you want to see what my website orginally looked like, you can view my site on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20240130051947/https://vachan-maker.github.io/posts&#34;&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 4 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;#100daystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>ListenBrainz - A tool for music tracking</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/track-your-music/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Listenbrainz is a service which you can use to track music that you listen to. It is an alternative to Last.fm. For the past few months, I  have been using ListenBrainz and I really enjoy using it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The great thing about this service is that most of the data is public and can be used by anyone for free. Also, no account is required for browsing through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://listenbrainz.org/statistics/?range=week&#34;&gt;global stats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;so-what-is-cool-about-listenbrainz&#34;&gt;So what is cool about ListenBrainz?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My favorite thing about ListenBrainz is the statistics it generates. It highlights top artists, albums and tracks that I listened to. It also generates a map that highlights the countries from which I&amp;rsquo;ve been jamming songs from. I love looking at the data, it is fun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another cool feature is, ListenBrainz automatically generates personalized playlists. These playlists are updated every week. The feature is fairly recent and could use improvement. Since I use YouTube Music primarily for streaming music, I don&amp;rsquo;t really use this feature. Users who listen to songs locally on the device or from a media server may find this feature really helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Discover users with the same taste as yours.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can pin tracks that you like on your profile and share and recommend songs to your followers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is also a feature to find the latest albums and track releases.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I just checked the MetaBrainz blog now (Jan 31, 2024) and guess what? The team just dropped a new feature called &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.metabrainz.org/2024/01/31/listenbrainz-music-neighborhood/&#34;&gt;Music Neighbourhood&lt;/a&gt; that lets you discover similar artists.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-to-get-started-with-listenbrainz&#34;&gt;How to get started with ListenBrainz?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On Android, you can use either the official &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/metabrainz/listenbrainz-android&#34;&gt;ListenBrainz app&lt;/a&gt; or an app called &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kawaiiDango/pano-scrobbler&#34;&gt;PanoScrobbler&lt;/a&gt;. The official app is great but I often had issues with the app. Sometimes, it would not detect songs and other times tracked songs would not appear in ListenBrainz for some reason. PanoScrobbler, on the other hand, is a great app and it has some cool features the former doesn&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my browser (Mozilla Firefox), I use &lt;a href=&#34;https://web-scrobbler.com/&#34;&gt;Web-Scrobbler&lt;/a&gt; browser extension to track my playback history. It supports scrobbling dozens of websites. I use the extension to record my listens from SoundCloud and YouTube Music.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you use Spotify then you can directly connect your account with ListenBrainz and track your playback history.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also use plugins with VLC/MPV or a music player that has ListenBrainz integration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are a nerd and you love looking at beautifully presented data and fancy graphs or you just want to gain insight into your music listening habits then ListenBrainz is a great option.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 3 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <title>List of Apps I use from F-Droid</title>
      <link>https://vachan.me/posts/apps-i-use-from-f-droid/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/&#34;&gt;F-Droid&lt;/a&gt; is a store for free and open source applications. Here are some of the apps from F-droid that I use daily.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;flashdimhttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomcyb3rkoflashdim&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.cyb3rko.flashdim/&#34;&gt;Flashdim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Flashdim is a cool flashlight app with neat features. One of it&amp;rsquo;s features is that it can convert text to morse code.  On supported devices running Android 13, you can also dim the flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;sealhttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomjunkfoodseal&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.junkfood.seal/&#34;&gt;Seal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I use Seal all the time. You can use Seal to download videos and audio from websites supported by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp&#34;&gt;yt-dlp&lt;/a&gt;. The app is easy to use and is based on &lt;a href=&#34;https://m3.material.io/&#34;&gt;Material Design 3&lt;/a&gt;. It has a ton of features like trimming video, converting the video/audio to another format, downloading subtitles and thumbnails of video and so on. I use it mostly to download videos from YouTube and Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;audilehttpsf-droidorgenpackagescommrsepmusicrecognizer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.mrsep.musicrecognizer/&#34;&gt;Audile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have been looking to replace &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shazam_(application)&#34;&gt;Shazam&lt;/a&gt; for the longest and Audile is the answer to it. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the app worked and it exceeded my expectations. Audile also displays useful metadata and displays links to various streaming services after recognizing a song.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;next-playerhttpsf-droidorgenpackagesdevanilbeesettinextplayer&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/dev.anilbeesetti.nextplayer/&#34;&gt;Next Player&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next Player is basically a video player. The app has a clean and simple interface. Now, the app is not as feature packed as &lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.videolan.vlc/&#34;&gt;VLC media player&lt;/a&gt; but Next Player gets the job done quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;kdeconnecthttpsf-droidorgenpackagesorgkdekdeconnect_tp&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.kde.kdeconnect_tp/&#34;&gt;KDEConnect&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;KDEConnect is my favorite app on the list. It is a great app for integrating your smartphone with your computer. You can send and receive files to and from your computer, use your phone as a trackpad or presentation remote, synchronize notifications, clipboard and contacts from your phone, control media  and so much more. If you are using GNU/Linux, then you can even run commands from your phone - I can shutdown my laptop just by using my phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;bitwardenhttpsmobileappbitwardencomfdroid&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mobileapp.bitwarden.com/fdroid/&#34;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwarden&#34;&gt;Bitwarden&lt;/a&gt; is an open source password manager. The mobile app is not on the main F-droid repository due to a technical limitation  but is hosted on a custom repository which can be added to your F-droid app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;aegishttpsf-droidorgenpackagescombeemdevelopmentaegis&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.beemdevelopment.aegis/&#34;&gt;Aegis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Prior to using Aegis, I used Authy for storing my TOTP tokens. What I loved about &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Authy&amp;amp;redirect=no&#34;&gt;Authy&lt;/a&gt; at the time was it&amp;rsquo;s cloud sync feature. Later, I found Aegis while casually scrolling Reddit and let me tell you Authy comes nowhere close to how good Aegis is. The app has a lot of features, is open source and you can import and export your Aegis vault and even create backups. I am planning to write a detailed blog post on why Authy sucks.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;tuskyhttpsf-droidorgenpackagescomkeylesspalacetusky&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.keylesspalace.tusky/&#34;&gt;Tusky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tusky is my preferred client app for &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastodon_(social_network)&#34;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t know what Mastodon is, I highly recommend you to check it &lt;a href=&#34;https://joinmastodon.org/&#34;&gt;out&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, the official Mastodon app is good but I just can’t get myself to stick with the official app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;simple-keyboardhttpsf-droidorgpackagesrkrsimplekeyboardinputmethod&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://f-droid.org/packages/rkr.simplekeyboard.inputmethod/&#34;&gt;Simple Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look through Google Play and F-droid, you can find keyboards with a lot of features like GIF integration, sticker generation, etc. Simple keyboard is basically the opposite to this. It is a keyboard and nothing more. No emojis, no spell checker and no extra features.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is post 2 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;thirdsem.webp&#34;&#xA;         alt=&#34;A blackboard in a classroom of a college building. There are some chairs facing the board as well. Time Flies. Chapter 3/8 completed is written of the board&#34;/&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;            &lt;p&gt;Caption: This is not the classroom of my college, it is Chengannur Engineering College&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;        &lt;/figcaption&gt;&#xA;&lt;/figure&gt;&#xA;&#xA;Hey everyone!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am really excited to write this post as this is my first &amp;lsquo;real&amp;rsquo; post. Currently, I am studying Computer Science and Engineering in a college in Kerala and I finished my third semester. As of this day, I am writing my end semester examinations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The semester officially began in the first week of September and ended right before Christmas holidays(2023). Final exams commenced in the first week of January, 2024 and are still ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the first two semesters which mainly focused on non core subjects such as mechanics, physics, chemistry and electronics, I eagerly looked forward to the third semester because we delved deeper into the core subjects which included discrete mathematics, object oriented programming in Java (OOP in Java), logic system design and data structure &amp;amp; algorithms(DSA).  We also had lab sessions for OOP in Java and DSA.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The third semester kicked off with a new classroom in the new block of our college. Our classroom is right below the Principal&amp;rsquo;s office and next to our teachers staff room. It is a strategic location.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-enjoyed&#34;&gt;What I enjoyed!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;lab-sessions&#34;&gt;Lab Sessions&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I really loved going to the lab and doing programming.It was really cool to mess around with the code. Now, I am not a smart guy and some of the programs we learned were challenging but with the help from my friends and teachers, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t a really big problem. You know what I really enjoyed the most? Helping my friends find bugs in their programs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After completing some programs, we would go around the lab and help our friends fix issues with their code. It was really fun. Most of the time, it was really easy to fix the bugs. But there were moments we would just stare at the code for a long time, not knowing why the program wouldn&amp;rsquo;t run. It was a mix of fun and frustration.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;free-periods&#34;&gt;Free Periods&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another great thing was that we had more free periods than the first two semesters. We would talk a lot. The teachers staff room is right next to our class and usually a teacher would come and shout at us for talking so loud. Some of my friends made most of the time by playing games like UNO. I would turn on my phone and watch an episode of my favorite tv show or just take a nap.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-i-did-not-enjoy&#34;&gt;What I did not enjoy&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the core subjects, we had two more subjects - professional ethics and sustainable engineering. I found these subjects really boring and didn&amp;rsquo;t really like them. It sometimes put me to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Record writing is an important part of the engineering life and I still don&amp;rsquo;t see the point of writing these records. It takes too much time and effort and the time spent for writing records can be used for something else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;new-skills&#34;&gt;New Skills&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of this semester I made a decision to focus more towards improving my programming skills. With some push from my friends, I went ahead with learning Flutter. I learned to create some simple applications from YouTube. One of the apps I built was a simple unit converter app. In addition to this, I created a simple birthday app that displays your age after entering your birthday.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also learned to create a simple static site from scratch using Hugo. Yes, my site currently uses a theme but in the future, I will probably shift to a custom designed theme.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;wrapping-up&#34;&gt;Wrapping Up!&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So there you have it! That is a wrap on my third semester. I had a blast and a great time with my friends. I also learned some new things. Now, I am looking at five more semesters ahead. I can&amp;rsquo;t wait for the start of the next semester. Wish me luck!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is day 1 of &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;#100DaystoOffload&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
