            <p>Okay, so I know its been a long time since I wrote any posts here. I just want to give everyone an update.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t written posts for so long because I have become a little bit more busy with college. I am also spending some of my of time coding little projects and learning new stuff.</p>
<p>But I think the actual reason is my laziness. I do like writing these posts but most of the time I am just lazy to do it. Writing a post requires time and sometimes research.  I have to read my posts several times and look for any typos or mistakes. Sometimes, I come across big blunders after publishing a post.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier how I have become a bit more busy. But I am not so busy that I can&rsquo;t find time to write a post. I am just lazy to spend some effort in writing.</p>
<p>Yes, I have lost my initial enthusiasm when I started this blog. I also kind of have lost interest in the #100DaystoOffload challenge. But does this mean, I have given up? Not yet. I am going to keep trying.</p>
<p>So I am currently in the fifth semester (3rd year) in college and I am getting closer to finishing my course. (3 more semesters to go!)</p>
<p>So how is this semester? To be completely honest, it is boring. IMO, this sem is the least interesting semester yet.</p>
<p>I have to learn subjects such as Microprocessor, System Software, Finite Language and Automata Theory, Computer Networking, etc.</p>
<p>But just because these subjects are boring doesn&rsquo;t mean I can&rsquo;t just shut my brain and not learn them. I have to study these subjects and pass the exams.</p>
<p>Anyway, the good thing is that this semester will be over by the beginning of November.</p>
<p>So I wrote this mainly to just get myself more active in writing blog posts. More posts are coming!</p>
