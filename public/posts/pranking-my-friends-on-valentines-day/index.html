            <hr />
            <p>Check out the <a href="https://love-calc-project.netlify.app/">Love Calculator</a> before reading the post!</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t it great? lol</p>
<p>If you didn&rsquo;t check it out, basically it is a website that asks a person who their crush is and tries to calculate their love percentage. But in the end it just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling">rickrolls</a> the person.</p>
<p>This not my idea but I stole it from a guy named Aldrin, who made this for April Fools Day. You can check out his project <a href="https://aldrinjenson.github.io/Love-Calc/">here</a></p>
<p>I came across Aldrin&rsquo;s work on the eve of Valentine&rsquo;s day and I really wanted to make something like this. Knowing that it wouldn&rsquo;t take too long, I started to work on it immediately. I had a lab exam the next day, so I couldn&rsquo;t spend too much time with it.</p>
<p>I created two HTML files, added a dummy form and used <a href="https://simplecss.org">simple.css</a> . For the second page, I embeded some funny gifs from GIPHY and Rick Astley&rsquo;s Never Gonna Give You Up from SoundCloud. Voila! It&rsquo;s done.</p>
<p>Well, it didn&rsquo;t work very well.</p>
<p>The SoundCloud embed loaded slowly and sometimes the song didn&rsquo;t autoplay even though I had enabled autoplay for the widget. To fix this, I downloaded the song and used the HTML <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> autoplay attribute instead.</p>
<p>Now, let the fun begin!</p>
<p>I put the link as my status on WhatsApp and shared it to a few of my friends. Since, the form didn&rsquo;t actually submit responeses, I had no clue how many people used it. But some of my friends messaged me and they liked it.</p>
<h2 id="love-calculator-20-">Love Calculator 2.0 ü§£Ô∏èü§£Ô∏è</h2>
<p>After my exam, I decided to improve it and have more fun.</p>
<p>I use Netlify for hosting the project and one of the cool features Netlify offers is form handling. It is super easy to use and free!. So I added this feature to the form.</p>
<p>I also replaced the GIPHY embeds with .webp files.</p>
<p>Now, let the fun begin, again!! hehe</p>
<p>I posted the link again as my status and one of my friends posted it in our main college class WhatsApp group.</p>
<p>Most of the responses, about 30 in total, were really funny.</p>
<p>I had a really great time with this love calculator thing. It was really fun!</p>
<p>This is day 7 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaystoOffload</a></p>
