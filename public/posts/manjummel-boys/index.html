            <p class="postMeta"><strong>Posted On:</strong> Fri May 10, 2024 </p>
            <hr />
            <p>2024 seems to be a good year for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_cinema">malayalam cinema</a> industry. A lot of great movies came out this year. (I haven&rsquo;t watched all of them yet)</p>
<p>So today right after I came back from college, I decided to watch the malayalam survival-thriller movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26458038/"><em>Manjummel Boys</em></a> on my phone. I have been eagerly waiting to watch this movie since its release in February. It was really popular and received positive reviews from people during its theatrical run.</p>
<p><em>Manjummel Boys</em> is based on a real-life incident. A group of friends go on a trip to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal">Kodaikkanal</a> but then things take a wild turn when one of them falls into a pit.</p>
<p>I was left on the edge of my seat while I was watching this. The movie was highly engaging from the start and I lost track how much time had passed. I just couldn&rsquo;t put my phone down.</p>
<p>Personally, as I watched the movie, I felt a mix of emotions. Many moments in the film made me cry. It delivered great levels of anxiety, fear and intensity.</p>
<p>In addition, friendship is a strong theme throughout the film and I could totally relate to it.</p>
<p>Cinematography and production was top-notch. Ajayan Chalissery did an excellent job in designing and making a realistic replica of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna_Caves">Guna Caves</a>. But I do feel like the VFX could have been more realsitic.</p>
<p>To wrap things up, <em>Manjummel Boys</em> is a an awesome thriller movie. It is definetly a must watch. I would have enjoyed this movie even more, if I had watched this in theaters.</p>
<p>If you have seen it, I would love to hear from you.</p>
<p>Btw, this is my first film review, if you have any feedback, please e-mail me.</p>
<p>This is day 23 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaystoOffload</a></p>
