So day before yesterday (Sat March 16, 2024) our college arts fest came to an end. The name of the arts festival this year was &lsquo;Thira&rsquo;. Last year the name was &lsquo;Drishya&rsquo;. (Yes, every year there is a different name). It lasted three days. Thira 2K24 was inaugurated by an alumnus of our college.</p>
<p>Last year, a tech fest was held a day before arts. This year there was no tech fest.</p>
<p>Despite several challenges, our seniors did a great job in hosting the event. The campus was decorated and the events and competitions were all good. Also, the newly constructed open air auditorium was inaugurated.</p>
<p>I went only on the first and second day.</p>
<p>There were a lot of competitions - some of them were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam">Bharatanatyam</a>, Couples dance, group dance, band performance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanchippattu">Vanchipattu</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppana">Oppana</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffmuttu">Duffmuttu</a>. There were also writing and drawing competitions.</p>
<p>The main highlight of arts fest and what everyone eagerly waited for was the music concert. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jassie_Gift">Jassie Gift</a>, a Malayalam playback singer, was the main performer this year. Last year, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fejo_(rapper)">Fejo</a> came to our college.</p>
<p>The concert was awesome and we all had a great time. Jassie Gift came with band and the group performed a lot of great songs (malayalam, hindi and tamil songs). The sound and the lights elevated the whole concert.</p>
