            <hr />
            <p>I still find it hard to believe that I am already in the fourth semester. After two or three months, I will be stepping into my third year in college. Time sure flies!</p>
<p>The semester actually began on the 29th of January, about six days after my third sem final exams. So there wasn&rsquo;t really a long break or anything. Not  only that but I also had to write a supplementary exam for Engineering Graphics on the 30th. Unfortunately, I did not perform well in the exam. So I will most likely be attending the exam again in this sem.</p>
<p>Even though the third semester was completed, our lab exams for it hasn&rsquo;t been completed and is scheduled to start in the first week of February. So I was busy writing the records during the short break.

</p>
<p>In this semester, I have to learn the following courses</p>
<ul>
<li>Database Management System</li>
<li>Graph Theory</li>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Computer Organisation &amp; Architechture</li>
<li>Constitution of India</li>
<li>Design &amp; Engineering</li>
</ul>
<p>We also have 2 labs - Operating system &amp; digital electronics</p>
<p>Classes are going alright. It still hasn&rsquo;t gotten serious. Usually in the afternoon, we get free periods.</p>
<p>I also started playing volleyball with my friends during lunch break in the scorching sun. It is fun. :)

<p>These are some things I want to accomplish by the end of this term.</p>

<li>Its been a quite some time, since I last used Flutter and I want to make another simple app with it.</li>
<li>Learn more about data structures and algorithms.</li>
<li>Maybe apply for an internship?</li>
<li>Clear my engineering graphics exam. This time I am going study for it properly.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I hope this semester will go smoothly for me and I will be able to score good grades. Plus, I aspire on improving my coding skills.</p>
