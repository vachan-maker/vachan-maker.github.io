            <p class="postMeta"><strong>Posted On:</strong> Wed May 8, 2024 </p>
            <hr />
            <p>I created my google account all the way back in 2014.</p>
<p>I came to know about how mega companies like Meta, Google and Microsoft track every single thing that you do and how they violate your privacy. I watched a lot of videos from Youtube channels such as Techlore and The Hated One.</p>
<p>This all happened in 2020 during the lockdown.</p>
<p>I deleted my instagram account, created a Tutanota and Protonmail account and started to use front-ends for sites like YouTube and Reddit.</p>
<p>But four years later, I still haven&rsquo;t been able to stop using my google account. I had made a decision to slowly migrate from my Google account but that never happened.</p>
<h3 id="so-why-havent-i-switched">So why haven&rsquo;t I switched?</h3>
<p>The answer is simple. It is because of all the apps and services provided by Google are free, easy and convenient to use.</p>
<p>I am also kind of lazy to do it because the whole switching process doesn&rsquo;t happen with the snap of a finger.</p>
<p>I backup my data on my phone to google drive, store documents and other files in drive, edit documents on Google Docs and store photos on google photos.</p>
<p>But we all know when you are not paying for it, you are the product.</p>
<p>Many of you reading this will probably want to ask me &lsquo;Why not just self-host?&rsquo;</p>
<p>I would really love to self host apps like NextCloud but I just don&rsquo;t have the money to set up a server.</p>
<p>Buying a rasberry pi in India is expensive and I would also have to spend more money on storage.</p>
<p>Yes, there are free third-party instances of Nextcloud and free cloud storage providers like Mega. But I don&rsquo;t want to use those. If I am going to switch, I want to use software which I have control over.</p>
<h3 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h3>
<p>I am just going to keep using my Google account for now(I don&rsquo;t really have any other option). But in the future when I have the money, I will definetly switch to self hosted appplications. It is something that I am very eager to use.</p>
