            <hr />
            <p>A while back I wrote a post on the apps that I use to stream music. However, before I had my own smartphone and before streaming services became popular, I used an iPod nano to listen to music. If you don&rsquo;t remember it, an iPod nano is similar to an iPod shuffle but with an LCD screen. (I don&rsquo;t have my iPod with me anymore but <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/docs/ipod/133018">here</a> is a photo of it I found.)</p>
<p>I graciously received my friend&rsquo;s iPod Nano after asking if I could have it, as he was already using his phone for listening to music.</p>
<p>I loved my iPod and I used it all the time to listen to songs. If I remember correctly, my iPod had 8GB of storage and that was plenty of space to store more than a thousand songs. Since it was so small, I could carry it in my pocket anywhere.</p>
<p>One of the great benefits of using an iPod was that I had complete control over my library. I decided what songs should be in my library not some algorithm. Since all the songs were stored locally, I could listen to my favoruite songs offline too.</p>
<p>You needed to connect to a computer to download music to your iPod. Even though it may seem inconvenient, the process of loading music into the iPod was kind of fun. I usually would spend time adding metadata and album art to each track that I downloaded.</p>
<p>These days, using a streaming service like Spotify gets you access to millions of songs within seconds. I have discovered a lot of good songs thanks to the algorithm. But you don&rsquo;t have full control or ownership of songs. Sometimes, the songs in your library may even vanish all of a sudden due to licensing agreements or the artist&rsquo;s decision. Plus, these streaming services are a privacy nightmare and collect a lot of data about you.</p>
<p>Even though the era of the mp3 players can be considered as dead, there are still a large number of people who prefer storing music locally on their device or hosting music on a server and this is analogous to using your own iPod or mp3 player.</p>
<p>I highly recommend you to check out Jeff Geerling&rsquo;s video - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CDKvdlD6uQ">Forget spaceships, I just want my music</a></p>
