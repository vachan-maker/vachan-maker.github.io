            <p class="postMeta"><strong>Posted On:</strong> Sat Jul 27, 2024 </p>
            <hr />
            <p>Due to Microsoft&rsquo;s strict hardware requirements for Windows 11, I decided to ditch Windows entirely and switch to Linux in 2023. A few years back,I had attempted to try out Ubuntu but that failed miserably and I actually ended up destroying my USB drive in the process (I failed at step 1 and I still don&rsquo;t know how I broke my flashdrive&hellip;.lol).</p>
<p>Anyway, one of most the challenging aspect of switching to GNU/Linux is choosing a distribution. There are a ton of options out there and it can feel overwhelming. Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop OS! and Fedora are some of the most recommended distributions for beginners.</p>
<p>As mentioned in title of this post, after doing my research, I finally went with Debian stable.</p>
<p>Okay here is the thing - I am a guy who actually loves using the latest software on my device. I love trying out new features and being up to date. So you might be scratching your head and probably thinking &ldquo;Why on earth did this guy install Debian stable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here are the reasons why I selected Debian:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>High Stability - Debian is loved by many Linux users for its stability and reliability. Debian is considered as a good and trustworthy friend who will never let you down. I wanted to experience why people loved debian so much and the rock solid nature of debian first hand.</p>
<p>I just wanted a distro that works and didn&rsquo;t want to spend time fixing things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Release of Debian Bookworm - I installed Debian on my laptop, a month after the release of Debian bookworm. At that time, the release of Debain 12 was making buzz everywhere and many Linux youtubers were doing reviews and posting videos about it. People were really excited about it and all this excitement made me want to try debian.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Snaps - I still think Ubuntu would have actually been a good option for me but the only reason I decided not to go with Ubuntu is because of how the distribution constantly forced people to use snaps.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been using Debian for a year now and I am really happy with it. Yes, I still kind of miss having the latest updates and software on my system but thanks to flatpaks I can still have access to the newest versions of software without having to use <a href="https://backports.debian.org/">backports</a> (which I haven&rsquo;t tried yet).</p>
