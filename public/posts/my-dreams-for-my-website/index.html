            <hr />
            <p>When I started using Mastodon account 4 years ago, what really caught my attention was that most of the people on it  had their own personal website. This was really cool!</p>
<p>I started my website at the end of last year. Since then, I have spent quite a lot of time writing posts and designing my website. Working on my blog has taught me so much!</p>
<p>First of all, I want people to learn something new from my website. I would like my site to be like a library. The content in here should inspire a person to try something new (it could be an app,a project, etc).</p>
<p>My website is a combination of things I have learned from looking at other individuals websites and reading their posts. It was because of users on Mastodon that I really felt the urge to create this site. It was because of someone who decided to write that post on &lsquo;adding a last modified date or setting up a recent posts section&rsquo; that I now have these implemented on my site. Like this, I want to do the same thing to others.</p>
<p>I am also planning on set up a wiki as well so that I can share the things I learn and refer back to it when I need to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I wish to showcase my skills and some of the small projects that I have done.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, I really want to write and publish a lot of posts here. That is why I decided to participate in the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100DaystoOffload</a> challenge. I want to write posts about a lot of things (about my college, exams, good memories, new things I learned and so on) and not just technical posts.</p>
<p>In the future, I hope to come back to the posts that I wrote and be like &ldquo;Hey, that was really cool!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Those were some good times&rdquo; or &ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t have done that&rdquo; and relive those moments.</p>
<p>Now, I am not a good writer but I really hope to improve my writing skills and improve my vocabulary.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that is really all&hellip;. I just want to help people and enjoy working on improving my space on the web.</p>
<p>This is day 16 of <a href="https://100daystooffload.com">#100Daystooffload</a></p>
