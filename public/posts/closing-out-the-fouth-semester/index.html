            <hr />
            <p>Hey
So I just wrapped up my fourth semester and I am so excited, relieved and thrilled. This semester was somewhat short - not even my teachers could cover the entire syllabus. On top of that, preparing for the final examinations was kind of stressful and I just finished my exams two days ago.</p>
<p>I would consider this semester as a really boring semester, I really didn&rsquo;t enjoy it.</p>
<p>In this semester, I studied</p>
<ul>
<li>Computer Organisation &amp; Architecture (COA)</li>
<li>Operating Systems</li>
<li>Graph Theory</li>
<li>Database Managements Systems (DBMS)</li>
<li>Design &amp; Engineering</li>
</ul>
<p>COA is the subject that I found the most difficult. I just couldn&rsquo;t get myself to study it. DBMS on the other hand was actually manageable but it was really vast. Rest of the subjects were fine.</p>
<p>So far, I am kind of disappointed with the course I am studying. It was always my dream from 10th grade to become a developer. But all I study in college is a bunch of theoretical stuff. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t really want to learn the inner workings of a computer. All I want to do is to create a cool app or a website.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know&hellip;.maybe there will be something for me in the upcoming semesters.</p>
<h2 id="how-did-my-exams-go">How did my exams go?</h2>
<p>Yeah&hellip;.exams were alright. If you don&rsquo;t know me, I am a person who learns everything in the last moment (Usually during the break before an exam).</p>
<p>I actually had plenty of days between exams so that was a big relief. But my university unexpectedly changed the entire examination timetable between our exams. This was a big slap in the face for everyone because it actually not only extended the whole examination period but also reduced the days between exams.</p>
<p>For me the sudden move made by the university was actually kind of a blessing because I got a few days to study for my engineering graphics supplementary paper. I am pretty sure I am going to pass the paper this time.</p>
<p>Remember how I said that COA was the subject that I dread the most? Well, the COA paper was alright and I am confident that I am going to clear that as well.</p>
<p>But out of all the exams, preparing for the Operating System paper was probably the most stressful because I had exactly one day to study five modules. Fortunately, I was actually able to cover about four modules and prepared for the exam pretty well.</p>
<p>A few of my friends also had arranged online classes on Discord and this actually was super helpful. I was able to answer many of the questions in the exam just because of studying with my bros.

</p>
<h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up</h2>
<p>During the first two semesters, preparing for exams was hectic but by the fourth semester I&rsquo;ve gotten good at handling exams. I even managed to squeeze in time to watch Back to the Future 2 &amp; 3(the entire BTTF trilogy is awesome) between all this studying. I&rsquo;ve realized that as long as I put in hard work and prepare well, there is no need to worry too much. I know I will be able pass my exams(hopefullyðŸ˜…).</p>
