### Albums I love
- What About Me? by Snarky Puppy
	- This album is a masterpiece. I think Snarky Puppy is what really got me into listening to jazz and instrumental music. All the tracks in the album are awesome and I have listened to the entire album several times. Its that good. If you haven't heard this album, I would highly recommend you to check it out. 
	- Lingus and Shofukan are my favourite performances from the album.
- 1989 by Taylor Swift
- Swim Slowly by Meltt
