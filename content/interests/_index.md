## Music
I listen to a wide variety of music. If a song sounds good, I will be probably listening to it in an infinite loop...lol. When writing assignments or studying, I usually listen to lofi, classical,movie soundtracks or instrumental music.

I am a big fan of Coldplay and love listening to their songs. I also listen to songs by Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Olivia Rodrigo and Billie Eilish (just to name a few).

I also enjoy listening to instrumental music and soundtracks.

Here are some songs I love:
1. [Jacob Collier - Little Blue (feat. Brandi Carlile)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2zLSkhANSY)
2. [Coldplay - All My Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfawgZ5bfBQ)
3. [20syl - Ongoing Thing (feat. Oddisee)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xkm8mGlfm9w)
