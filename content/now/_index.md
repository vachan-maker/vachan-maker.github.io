Welcome to my now page. Here is what I am doing now! You can learn more about now pages [here](https://nownownow.com/about)

I am in my fourth semester in college. After 4 more semesters, I will complete my course.

### What I am reading
- [The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion,_the_Witch_and_the_Wardrobe)
### What I am watching
**Anime** - [Solo Levelling](https://anilist.co/anime/151807/Solo-Leveling/), [Attack On Titan Season 3](https://anilist.co/anime/99147/Shingeki-no-Kyojin-3/)

**TV Show** - Modern Family

### What I am working on
- A game blog with my friends. They provide the content and I am responsible for publishing and maintaing the blogsite.
- I am also working on completing the [#100daystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com) challenge.

### Ideas
- Make a statuslog using RSS feed from mastodon and display it on my website.
- Make a dashboard which shows anime, tv show episodes and movies I watched recently.
