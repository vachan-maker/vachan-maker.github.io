Hey there! I am Vachan and I love thinkering with computers. I am currently pursuing Computer Science and Engineering.

I am a big fan of Open Source Software and Linux. Currently, running Debian 12 (Bookworm) on my laptop.

### My Hobbies and Interests
- I love watching TV shows and movies. You can check out what I watch by clicking [here](https://trakt.tv/users/vchn-mkr).
- I have strong passion for listening to music. I enjoy listening to pop, instrumental and soundtracks. You can checkout what I listen to by going to my ListenBrainz [profile](https://listenbrainz.org/user/vchn-mkr/).
- If you are wondering whether I watch anime, the answer is yes, but I am not a hardcore fan.
- Photography is something I do casually. Feel free to check out some of my photos on [pixelfed](https://portfolio.pixelfed.social/V4vachan).
