A couple of days ago it was my Dad's birthday and our close family friend brought a carrot cake to celebrate. My mom asked if I was going to eat the cake and I said no and told her that I was going to bring the cake to college and eat it with my friends.

A couple of hours later, a light bulb went off my head. I thought...hey why not pull a fake birthday prank on one of my friends?

It is a tradition for our class to cut a cake on someones birthday and its been quite some time since we cut a cake. So I messaged one of my friends and shared my awesome creative plan with him....lol.

The next day I brought the cake and I told some of my friends about it. We were all planning on when to cut the cake and how to do it in the first period.

During the first interval, we told everyone not to leave and sang happy birthday and made him cut the cake. It was hilarious and he was realy surprised and yelling that it was not even his bday!
