So yesterday (Sat March 16, 2024) our college arts fest came to an end. The name of the arts festival this year was 'Thira'. Last year the name was 'Drishya'. (Yes, every year there is a different name). It lasted three days. Thira 2K24 was inaugurated by an alumnus of our college.

Last year, a tech fest was held a day before arts. This year there was no tech fest.

Despite several challenges, our seniors did a great job in hosting the event. The campus was decorated and the events and competitions were all good. Also, the newly constructed open air auditorium was inaugurated.

I went only on the first and second day.

There were a lot of competitions - some of them were [Bharatanatyam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharatanatyam), Couples dance, group dance, band performance, [Vanchipattu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanchippattu), [Oppana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppana), [Duffmuttu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duffmuttu). There were also writing and drawing competitions.

The main highlight of arts fest and what everyone eagerly waited for was the music concert. [Jassie Gift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jassie_Gift), a Malayalam playback singer, was the main performer this year. Last year, [Fejo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fejo_(rapper)) came to our college.

The concert was awesome and we all had a great time. Jassie Gift came with band and the group performed a lot of great songs (malayalam, hindi and tamil songs). The sound and the lights elevated the whole concert.
