I am currenly enjoying a short break from college and I used the time for revamping my website. I did change the appearence of this site a few weeks ago but that was nothing major. I wanted my website to have a little bit more of a personal touch.

The whole process actually took a lot more time than I expected and it is still not complete.

The site now has a new color scheme - a really nice teal color palette. I actually came across the palette while going through Tailwind CSS documentation.

The whole website is a culmination of things I love from blogs of other people.

[Simple.css](https://simplecss.orgs) is used as the base for typograhy and spacing.

You might think 'why does the navigation menu looks so familiar?'. Well, it is copied from [Joel Chrono's](https://joelchrono.xyz) blog.

I also referred to the sites of [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk), [Robb Knight](https://rknight.me/), [Arun](https://arun.blog) and  [Simone Silvestroni](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/).

The text (വചൻ) above the navigation bar is actually my name written in [Malayalam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam), my mother tongue. The font used is [RIT Kutty Bold](https://rachana.org.in/glist-kutty-bold.html).

I also added some new pages.
- The [now](/now) page tells you what I am  doing now.
- [Uses](/uses) page tells you what hardware and software I use.
- A [faves](/faves) page for sharing the music, tv-shows and movies I like. It is not complete.
- A [home](/) page with two photos and some of my recent posts. Earlier my homepage just displayed my name and the link of my social media handles. I have moved that to the contact page, which is also new.

Furthere more, I added [goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) analytics to get an idea on how many people visit my site. There is also now a reply via email button at the bottom of every post. 

The whole process taught me a lot. Even though I reused most of the hugo code from the previous theme, I got a good grip on how Hugo works - about partials, pipes, directory structure, etc. I also gained insight on working with branches in git and using Sass for styling.

I really love how everything looks in the end. If you have any feedback, please feel free to get in touch with me.
