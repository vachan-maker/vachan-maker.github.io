I am currenly enjoying a short break from college and I used the time for revamping my website. I did change the appearence of this site a few weeks ago but that was nothing major. I wanted my website to have a little bit more of a personal touch.

The whole process actually took a lot more time than expected and it is still not complete.

The site now has a new color scheme - a really nice teal color palette. I actually came across the palette while I was going through Tailwind CSS documentation.

The whole website combines things I love from other people's websites. It was Arun's blog that really urged me to take this step.His 

You might think 'why does the navigation menu looks so familiar?'. Well, it is copied from Joel Chrono's website.

Also my site has some new pages.
- The now page tells you what I am  doing now.
- I noticed that most bloggers on Mastodon have a Uses page. So I decided to make one for myself. This page tells you what hardware and software I use.
- A faves page for sharing the music, tv-shows and movies I like. It is not complete.
- A home page with two photos and some of my recent posts. Earlier my homepage just displayed my name and the link of my social media handles. I have moved that to the contact page, which is also new.

I learned a lot more about Hugo from working on the revamp. There were some things about Hugo that I really didn't have a clear idea on.
