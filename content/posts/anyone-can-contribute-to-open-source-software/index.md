You don't need to know coding to contribute to open source software. Here are some ways you can make a contribution.

1. Pretty much all open source projects have an issue tracker. It is primarily used for bug reporting. So if you find a bug while using a software, report the bug to the maintainers by creating an issue. If you have an idea for a new feature or how an existing feature can be improved, open a feature request.
2. If you are a designer, you could help out a project by designing icons, logos, promotional materials and branding. You can also work on enchancing the user interface or user experience of a project.
3. You can help in writing documentation and tutorials. Having a good and clear documentation will help newcomers and users understand how the software works and what features and options are available. It will also help users troubleshoot issues that they may face.
4. Help translate or localize the software or documentation to your language. Localization increases accessibility and inclusiveness.
5. Help people who use the software and answer questions that they have on the project's forum site, issue tracker, subreddit or chatroom.
6. You can show your support and appreciation by making a donation to the project. Donating money can help ensure sustainability, development and maintenance of the software and its supporting infrastructure.
7. If you enjoy using the software, share it with your friends and family.
8. If you love organizing events and programs then you can help the project out by hosting conferences, meetups, hackathons and workshops.
