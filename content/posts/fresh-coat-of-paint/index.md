If you didn't know already, my website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator and I use a theme called Nightfall. Although the theme is simple and clean, there were some things which really bothered me. However, I have resolved most of the issues and thought I would share what I did with you.

- For navigation on mobile devices, a hamburger menu was used. Currently, I only have two links in my nav bar and there isn't a need for me to use it. Plus, these menus are not accessible to all. So I decided to remove it.
- All links are now underlined and have a contrasting colour.
- Typography has improved! Now, the body text uses [GeneralSans](https://www.fontshare.com/fonts/general-sans) font, which I discovered after browsing [Kev Quirk's](https://kevquirk.com/) website. The font size and line height has also changed. 
- I also made some changes to the structure of the [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) files. Some of the [div](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) classes have been replaced with [semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/semantics#semantics_in_html).

Making and testing these changes did take a few hours. But I am happy how it turned out in the end. If you have any suggestions, please do send me an e-mail or message me through Mastodon.
