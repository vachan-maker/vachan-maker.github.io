If you visit my contact page, I have clearly mentioned that I don't use Instagram, Facebook and Snapchat. It has been years since I deleted my Instagram account. A lot of my friends have asked me why I don't use Instagram, this is a proper reply post to them and anyone else.

I created my Instagram account when I was studying in 9th or 10th grade (I don't remember the exact date). Most of my friends had an account and so I decided to hop on the network as well.

Seeing the posts on Instagram actually inspired me to take photos. I spent quite a bit of time watching youtube videos, using Snapseed and Lightroom for editing and learning new techniques to take cool photos with my not so good phone camera. I got a decent number of likes and had some followers.

But slowly slowly, I started to become obesessed with likes. I would check the app every couple of minutes to see who liked my photos and if I had gotten any new followers. I would also wonder why this person or that person didn't like my post.

The whole obsession I had about likes and followers felt unhealthy and weird to me and this is one of the reasons why I left Instagram.

Another reason is privacy. Around 2020, I became aware about how companies constantly monitor us and sell our data to make money. I also learned about open-source and privacy respecting software. I actually kind of became obsessed with only using free and libre software and took a lot of steps to make sure that companies like Google and Facebook don't use my data without my permssion. I think this is the biggest factor that made my delete my account.

### So what is it like to not use Instagram?
Without Instagram, I feel like I miss out on a lot of things - especially new trends, viral reels, memes and stuff. (This is something I don't really care about)
But I do miss out on a lot of posts, stories and pics from my friends. Yes, the whole fear of missing out (FOMO) thing is there but I only feel it sometimes.

I am not sure about it but I think I am the only in my class who don't use Instagram. 

Regardless of not using Instagram, I've managed to maintain good friendships and that is what matters the most. It is also fun to watch peoples face when I tell them I don't use Instagram...hehe.
