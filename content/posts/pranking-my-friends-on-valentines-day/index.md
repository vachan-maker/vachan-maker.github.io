Check out the [Love Calculator](https://love-calc-project.netlify.app/) before reading the post!

Isn't it great? lol

If you didn't check it out, basically it is a website that asks a person who their crush is and tries to calculate their love percentage. But in the end it just [rickrolls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickrolling) the person.

This not my idea but I stole it from a guy named Aldrin, who made this for April Fools Day. You can check out his project [here](https://aldrinjenson.github.io/Love-Calc/)

I came across Aldrin's work on the eve of Valentine's day and I really wanted to make something like this. Knowing that it wouldn't take too long, I started to work on it immediately. I had a lab exam the next day, so I couldn't spend too much time with it.

I created two HTML files, added a dummy form and used [simple.css](https://simplecss.org) . For the second page, I embeded some funny gifs from GIPHY and Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up from SoundCloud. Voila! It's done. 

Well, it didn't work very well. 

The SoundCloud embed loaded slowly and sometimes the song didn't autoplay even though I had enabled autoplay for the widget. To fix this, I downloaded the song and used the HTML `<audio>` autoplay attribute instead.

Now, let the fun begin!

I put the link as my status on WhatsApp and shared it to a few of my friends. Since, the form didn't actually submit responeses, I had no clue how many people used it. But some of my friends messaged me and they liked it.

## Love Calculator 2.0 ü§£Ô∏èü§£Ô∏è

After my exam, I decided to improve it and have more fun.

I use Netlify for hosting the project and one of the cool features Netlify offers is form handling. It is super easy to use and free!. So I added this feature to the form.

I also replaced the GIPHY embeds with .webp files. 

Now, let the fun begin, again!! hehe

I posted the link again as my status and one of my friends posted it in our main college class WhatsApp group.

Most of the responses, about 30 in total, were really funny.

I had a really great time with this love calculator thing. It was really fun!
