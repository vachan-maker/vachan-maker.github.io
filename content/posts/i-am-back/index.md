Okay, so I know its been a long time since I wrote any posts here. I just want to give everyone an update.

I haven't written for so long because I have become a little bit more busy with college. I am also spending some of my time coding little projects and learning new stuff.

But I think the actual reason is my laziness. I do like writing these posts but most of the time I am just lazy to do it. Writing a post requires time and sometimes research.  I have to read my post several times and look for any typos or mistakes. Sometimes, I come across big blunders after publishing a post.

I mentioned earlier how I have become a bit more busy. But I am not so busy that I can't find time to write a post. I am just lazy to spend some effort in writing.

Yes, I have lost my initial enthusiasm when I started this blog. I also kind of have lost interest in the #100DaystoOffload challenge. But does this mean, I have given up? Not yet. I am going to keep trying.

So I am currently in the fifth semester (3rd year) in college and I am getting closer to finishing my course. (3 more semesters to go!) 

So how is this semester? To be completely honest, it is boring. IMO, this sem is the least interesting semester yet.

I have to learn subjects such as Microprocessor, System Software, Finite Language and Automata Theory, Computer Networking, etc.

But just because these subjects are boring doesn't mean I can't just shut my brain and not learn them. I have to study these subjects and pass the exams.

Anyway, the good thing is that this semester will be over by the beginning of November.

So I wrote this short post mainly to just get myself more active in writing. More posts are coming!

This is day 36 of [#100DaystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
