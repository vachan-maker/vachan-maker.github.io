2024 seems to be a good year for the [malayalam cinema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malayalam_cinema) industry. A lot of great movies came out this year. (I haven't watched all of them yet)

So today right after I came back from college, I decided to watch the malayalam survival-thriller movie [*Manjummel Boys*](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt26458038/) on my phone. I have been eagerly waiting to watch this movie since its release in February. It was really popular and received positive reviews from people during its theatrical run.

*Manjummel Boys* is based on a real-life incident. A group of friends go on a trip to [Kodaikkanal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodaikanal) but then things take a wild turn when one of them falls into a pit.

I was left on the edge of my seat while I was watching this. The movie was highly engaging from the start and I lost track how much time had passed. I just couldn't put my phone down.

Personally, as I watched the movie, I felt a mix of emotions. Many moments in the film made me cry. It delivered great levels of anxiety, fear and intensity.

In addition, friendship is a strong theme throughout the film and I could totally relate to it.

Cinematography and production was top-notch. Ajayan Chalissery did an excellent job in designing and making a realistic replica of the [Guna Caves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guna_Caves). But I do feel like the VFX could have been more realsitic.

To wrap things up, *Manjummel Boys* is a an awesome thriller movie. It is definetly a must watch. I would have enjoyed this movie even more, if I had watched this in theaters.

If you have seen it, I would love to hear from you.

Btw, this is my first film review, if you have any feedback, please e-mail me.
