Last month, I did not publish a month in review because I was just feeling lazy (lol). So I have packed things I did in the last two months in this post.
## College
Classes are going alright. I don't really enjoy this semester. It is so hot and sitting in class in this heat is just unbearable. There is no other option but just to adjust to it.

I also had my internal exams and scored decent marks. But I am find it tough to study the paper - Computer Organization & Architecture.

## Updates to the site
As you can see, I have switched to a new domain [vachan.me](https://vachan-maker.github.io) which I am super thrilled about. But I don't really know what I will do when it expires next year. It was included for free in the Github Student Pack.

You also probably noticed the ðŸ¥³ emoji in the nav bar. When you click on it, party mode is activated. Wohooo! You can click on it as much as you want. I am planning on adding even more easter eggs.

## Movies
- **GoatLife (Aadujeevitham)**: I watched GoatLife, a malayalam survival film, directed by Blessy. GoatLife is based on the novel of the same name by Benyamin. The movie was okay. I just felt like there was something missing. It didn't really have that punch or emotional impact. Yes, Blessy and the entire crew worked really hard at making the film but it could have been better. It is a decent one time watch movie.
- **Premalu**: Premalu is a romantic comedy film starring Naslen and Mamitha Baiju. I think I watched the movie the day after watching GoatLife. This one was fun and a delight to watch. It's the usual guy has a cursh on a girl plot but with good humour. Premalu is a great choice to watch with friends and family.

## Music
Last month, I listened to a lot of songs by Coldplay, Taylor Swift, Ed Sheeran, Oliva Rodrigo and Ariana Grande.

I re-discovered the song Welcome to My Island and Bunny Is a Rider by Caroline Polachek.

## Results
Results of the third semester was published recently and I passed all subjects. Yayy! Now in a few more days, I will be writing fourth semester exams.

## Finishing Thoughts
I think that is all the pretty much things I can remember.

I am behind the 100 Days to Offload Challenge. I need to push more posts to my blog to finish the challenge within a year.

So that is all. Have a great day people!

This is day 24 of [#100DaystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
