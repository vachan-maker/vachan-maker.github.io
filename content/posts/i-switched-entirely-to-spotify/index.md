This isn't a promotional post...just sharing my thoughts and experience.

In June of this year, I published a [post](https://vachan.me/posts/apps-i-use-to-stream-music/) on the apps that I use to listen to music. I mentioned in the post about RiMusic - an open source android app that streams music from YouTube Music, Spotify and Soundcloud. At that time, I used RiMusic as my main music streaming application.

But since then things have changed. Now, I only use Spotify and YouTube for music.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that I couldn't play some songs on RiMusic and would get an error. This is most likely because of YouTube's crackdown on third party client applications.

Spotify's recommendation system is golden and I keep discovering new songs every week. There is a playlist for basically everything. Also since Spotify supports multiple platforms and has a web interface, I can access my playlists and favourite songs anywhere (this was not possible when using RiMusic).

I am currently using the free plan. Yes, the ads are annoying but I am fine with it. You can't get everything for free, right?

It's not all sunshine and rainbows though. There are still a lot of things that I don't like about Spotify. I hate how they are trying to push short form video content (tiktokification) and podcasts in my face. Recently, they are working on adding AI features. (Like literally every other company)

Also, you can't play an album in order without shuffling on the free plan, which is just stupid.

In addition to Spotify, YouTube also recommends some great songs - usually songs from artists that aren't really well known or I am discovering for the first time.

I still find it amazing that we live in an age where we can access millions of songs from around the world within the tap of a finger.

Yeah so that is really what I have to say about my switch to Spotify... I am kind of writing this post in a hurry as I have to go to college soon. I would love to hear your thoughts about this. Maybe you don't support Spotify and their use of DRM or you are probably the person who spends time tom maintain your own music library. Anyhow, drop a comment on Mastodon or  send me an email.
