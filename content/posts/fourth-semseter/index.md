I still find it hard to believe that I am already in the fourth semester. After two or three months, I will be stepping into my third year in college. Time sure flies! 

The semester actually began on the 29th of January, about six days after my third sem final exams. So there wasn't really a long break or anything. Not  only that but I also had to write a supplementary exam for Engineering Graphics on the 30th. Unfortunately, I did not perform well in the exam. So I will most likely be attending the exam again in this sem.

Even though the third semester was completed, our lab exams for it hasn't been completed and is scheduled to start in the first week of February. So I was busy writing the records during the short break.

In this semester, I have to learn the following courses
- Database Management System
- Graph Theory
- Operating Systems
- Computer Organisation & Architechture
- Constitution of India
- Design & Engineering

We also have 2 labs - Operating system & digital electronics

Classes are going alright. It still hasn't gotten serious. Usually in the afternoon, we get free periods.

I also started playing volleyball with my friends during lunch break in the scorching sun. It is fun. :)

## Goals  for this term
These are some things I want to accomplish by the end of this term.
- Make a small web app for saving my friends birthdays.
- Its been a quite some time, since I last used Flutter and I want to make another simple app with it.
- Learn more about data structures and algorithms.
- Maybe apply for an internship?
- Clear my engineering graphics exam. This time I am going study for it properly.

## Wrapping Up
Overall, I hope this semester will go smoothly for me and I will be able to score good grades. Plus, I aspire on improving my coding skills.
