Here is my bucket list. It is not complete, I will keep on adding things to it. Some of the items are completely random and crazy. (Maybe I won't update it or I will probably end )

- I want to go skydiving/parachuting(really scared to do it though)
- Fly in a helicopter
- Develop an app and publish it on the play store
- Write software that will be used by a lot of people
- Create a video game
- Visit Jammu and Kashmir and other famous places in India
- Go on a long trip on my bike
- Visit a country in each continent (I don't think this is going to happen...hehe)
- Go to Japan and visit Tokyo
- Workout and get a six pack
- I know the basics of playing the piano (not good at it though). But I want to improve my musical knowledge, learn other instruments and maybe even release an original song.
- Buy a poweful laptop
- Build a desktop PC
- Make a robot
- Own a house
- Set up a mini home theater in my house
- Talk and hangout with a famous person

This is all that comes to my mind now.

So do you have a bucket list? I would love to know.
