Google Plus (G+) was a social media site created by Google. It was shut down in 2019.

I created my account back in August of 2014 when I was in either fourth grade or fifth grade - I don't remember which.

I was actually super excited to create my account and told my parents about my account after I created it and they were actually OK with it.

Google was really trying hard to get people to use G+ and it was tightly integrated to pretty much all other google apps. The company was really forcing users to use it and I decided to give it a try.

One of the standout features was circles which  allowed you to group people into different groups. So you could share a post with a specific list of people. That was pretty cool! Also, instead of a like button, it had a +1 button.

Some of my friends from church used Google plus and we would share memes, funny videos and so on. I would jump on G+ every single day and was really active on the platform.

I even remember creating a page just for sharing funny posts. Only like 5 people followed it. lol.

I was part of the Minecraft community and would post some of my creations to the community. There were many other communities as well. I also was part of the clash of clans community. 

Another great feature of Google plus was their android app. It offered a solid experience.

Despite Google forcing people to use the platform, not many people actually used it. Instagram and Facebook attracted much more users. Nevertheless, I had a good time.

As mentioned earlier, google shut down the service in 2019. Google did allow users to download all the posts and data but unfortunately, I never downloaded the data which now I regret.

So did you actually use Google+ back then? What did you think of it? I would love to hear from you!
