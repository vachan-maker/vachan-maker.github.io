I know it has been a while since I have written a blog post. I only wrote four posts last month and I am super behind the #100DaystoOffload challenge. Here is what happened....(this is probably the most boring post I have written..hehe)

A few weeks ago my brother spilled coffee on my laptop and it completely ruined my external keyboard. Some of the keys were dead and it was basically impossible to type with. The scroll wheel of my mouse also didn't work properly. This really frustrated me.

Not only that, I am also busy with my fourth semester examinations, so I just haven't been in the mood to write posts.

For a few weeks, I stopped using my laptop and used my phone instead.

Eventually, I went on amazon and bought a new keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is just an ordinary plastic one but it is bigger than my previous keyboard and even splash-proof.

Anyway, tomorrow, I have an exam and I haven't even started studying yet...lol. After, this exam, I have two more exams to write.

Once my exams are over, I will be on a month long break and that means I will be able to spend more time writing. Wish me luck guys!

This is day 26 of [#100DaystoOffload](https://100daystooffload.com)
