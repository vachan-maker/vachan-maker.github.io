## Laptop
I use a Dell Inspiron 5447, it runs on [Debian 12 (Bookworm)](https://www.debian.org/). It is I think about 10 years old but works alright. But it is in terrible condition and I can't really carry it anywhere.
- Mozilla Firefox is my default web browser
- I use Inkscape for designing some simple posters.
- LibreOffice for editing documents
- I use [GoVarnam](https://varnamproject.com/) to type Malayalam
- Kdenlive for video editing
- GIMP for image editing
- Audacity and Tenacity for audio editing.
- I use Gedit primarily for text editing. Sometimes I use VS Code. I am learning to use Neovim.
- For recording my screen, I use OBS.
