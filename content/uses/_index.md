### Laptop
I use a Dell Inspiron 5447, it runs on [Debian 12 (Bookworm)](https://www.debian.org/). I think it is about 10 years old and it works alright. But it is not in the best condition so I can't really carry it anywhere.
- [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) is my default web browser
- I use [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) for designing some simple posters.
- [LibreOffice](https://libreoffice.org) for editing documents
- I use [GoVarnam](https://varnamproject.com/) to type Malayalam
- [Kdenlive](https://kdenlive.org/) for video editing
- [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) for image editing
- [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) or [Tenacity](https://tenacityaudio.org/) for audio editing. I have both of them installed.
- I use [Gedit](https://help.gnome.org/users/gedit/stable/) primarily for text editing. Sometimes I use Visual Studio. I am also learning to use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/).
- For recording my screen, I use [OBS](https://obsproject.com/).
